Inventory: You are carrying: a meal
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You have come into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. You can see a closed oven nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a counter. You see a raw purple potato, a green apple and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! There is an open plain door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is a knife, a salt, a white onion and a red hot pepper on the floor.
