-= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
Response (Response with the new environment description directly):


You are in a typical bedroom. There's a large, empty wardrobe and a chest of drawers that is also empty. A flickering light adds to the dull atmosphere. You spot a large bed with nothing on it, a standard nightstand with no items, and a usual desk chair that is empty as well. A dark carpet covers the floor, and there's an empty desk and dressing table. To exit, head east.

-= Bedroom =- You are in a typical bedroom. There's a large open wardrobe with a clean plaid polo shirt inside. A chest of drawers stands empty, and the light flickers briefly. You spot a large bed, but it's bare. A usual desk chair sits nearby, also empty. A standard nightstand has nothing on it, and a dark carpet covers the floor. By the wall, there's a desk, which is empty as well. A dressing table is present, but it too is empty. To exit, go east.
