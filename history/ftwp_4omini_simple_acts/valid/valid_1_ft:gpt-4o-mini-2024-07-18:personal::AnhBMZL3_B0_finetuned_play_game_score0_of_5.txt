Inventory: You are carrying: a lettuce a red apple a fried red onion
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You are in a kitchen. It seems to be pretty ordinary here. You decide to start listing off everything you see in the room, as if you were in a text adventure. You see an open fridge. The fridge contains a block of cheese. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. You can make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? On the table you can make out a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a counter. You wonder idly who left that here. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a raw red potato and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a stove. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an exit to the south.
