Current environment: -= Backyard =- You've just shown up in a backyard. You begin to take stock of what's here. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a patio chair. The patio chair is stylish. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Oh, great. Here's a patio table. You shudder, but continue examining the patio table. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a BBQ. There is an open patio door leading east. There is an open wooden door leading north. You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Inventory: You are carrying: a black pepper a sliced raw red tuna a green bell pepper a red apple
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You've just walked into a kitchen. You see a fridge. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's an oven. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? You can make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can see a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. There is an open frosted-glass door leading north. There is an open patio door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south.
