Inventory: You are carrying: a roasted red tuna a red hot pepper a roasted pork chop
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a kitchen, but I guess I was wrong. You can make out a fridge. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The fridge is empty, what a horrible day! Oh, great. Here's an oven. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You see a table. On the table you can see a cookbook and a knife. You make out a counter. However, the counter, like an empty counter, has nothing on it. You make out a stove. The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! There is an open plain door leading south. There is an open patio door leading west. There is an exit to the north.
