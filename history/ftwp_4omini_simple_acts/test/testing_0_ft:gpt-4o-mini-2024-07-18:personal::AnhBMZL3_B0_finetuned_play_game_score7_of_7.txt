Inventory: You are carrying: a meal
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You are in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of what's in the room. You make out a fridge! The fridge contains a red bell pepper. You can make out a closed oven. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a table. On the table you can see a cookbook. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. There is a knife on the floor.
