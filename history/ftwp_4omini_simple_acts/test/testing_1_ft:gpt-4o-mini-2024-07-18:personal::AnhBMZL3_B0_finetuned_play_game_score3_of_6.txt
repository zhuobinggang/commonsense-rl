Inventory: You are carrying: a knife
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You are in a kitchen. An usual kind of place. You can make out a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! Oh, great. Here's an oven. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a table. The table is massive. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You see a counter. You see a diced block of cheese, a raw red potato and a cookbook on the counter. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. You shudder, but continue examining the stove. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! There is a fried purple potato on the floor.
