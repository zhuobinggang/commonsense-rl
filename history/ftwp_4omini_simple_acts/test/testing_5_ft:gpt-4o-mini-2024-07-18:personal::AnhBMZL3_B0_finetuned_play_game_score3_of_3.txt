Current environment: -= Kitchen =- Look at that board! What does it say? It says Welcome to the kitchen? Well that's cool. You decide to just list off a complete list of everything you see in the room, because hey, why not? You can see a fridge. What a letdown! The fridge is empty! You see a closed oven. You can make out a table. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The table is massive. On the table you see a knife. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. Were you looking for a counter? Because look over there, it's a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a cookbook. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? But the thing hasn't got anything on it. There is an open frosted-glass door leading south. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the west.
