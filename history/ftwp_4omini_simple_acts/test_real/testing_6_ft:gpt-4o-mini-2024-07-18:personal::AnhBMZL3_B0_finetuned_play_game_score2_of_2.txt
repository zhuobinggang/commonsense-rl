Current environment: -= Kitchen =- This might come as a shock to you, but you've just walked into a kitchen. You see an open fridge. The fridge is empty! What a waste of a day! What's that over there? It looks like it's an oven. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. You see a cookbook on the counter. I mean, just wow! Isn't TextWorld just the best? You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Silly stove, silly, empty, good for nothing stove.
