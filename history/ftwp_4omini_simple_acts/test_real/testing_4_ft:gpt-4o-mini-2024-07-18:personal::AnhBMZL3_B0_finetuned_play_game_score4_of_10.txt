Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You are in a kitchen. A normal one. You begin to take stock of what's in the room. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw chicken leg. You scan the room for an oven, and you find an oven. Hmmm... what else, what else? You make out a table. The table is massive. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What's that over there? It looks like it's a counter. Now why would someone leave that there? On the counter you can see a cookbook and a knife. Look over there! a stove. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well There is an open screen door leading south. There is a closed plain door leading west. You need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
