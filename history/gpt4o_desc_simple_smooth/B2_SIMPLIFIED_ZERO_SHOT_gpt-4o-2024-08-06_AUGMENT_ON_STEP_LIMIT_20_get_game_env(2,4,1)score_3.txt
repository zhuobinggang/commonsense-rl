Environment: -= Bedroom =- You find yourself in an empty bedroom. There's a wardrobe with a clean azure skirt and a plaid pullover. Nearby, an open chest of drawers is completely empty. A large bed sits in the room, but it's unmade and empty. A usual desk chair is also present, but it has nothing on it. The dark carpet is bare as well. Leaning against the wall, you accidentally press a secret button, revealing a nightstand that is also empty. A dressing table and a normal desk are in the room, but both are devoid of items. You notice an entranceway to the south that isn't blocked by a door.
