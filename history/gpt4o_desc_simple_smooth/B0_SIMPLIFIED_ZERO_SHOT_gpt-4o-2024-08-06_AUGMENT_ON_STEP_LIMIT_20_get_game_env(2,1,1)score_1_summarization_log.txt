You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. The bookcase contains a clean white polo shirt. You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

You are in a familiar living room. There's an empty wastepaper basket and a bookcase with a clean white polo shirt. A sofa holds a checkered jumper, and a grey carpet looks bare. An armchair has a gray coat on it, while a side table and a TV stand are both empty. You stumble onto an end table with a brown suit. A coffee table nearby has a dictionary on it. You can go west through an unblocked entranceway.

-= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this?

-= Livingroom =- You are in a familiar living room. There’s an empty wastepaper basket and an empty bookcase. A sofa with a clean checkered jumper catches your eye. You follow an intriguing smell to a grey carpet, which is also bare. An armchair holds a gray coat, and a side table is empty. The TV stand is also empty. You accidentally bump into an end table with a brown suit on it. A coffee table nearby has a dictionary on it. You can exit to the west, as there’s no door blocking the way.

The environment description:
-= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see a closed wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
