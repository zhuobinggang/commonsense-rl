Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best?

Consideration: I am currently in a bedroom with a clean white polo shirt in my inventory. The bedroom has several pieces of furniture, including an opened wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a bed, a desk chair, a nightstand, a dark carpet, a desk, and a dressing table. Since the wardrobe is open and typically used for storing clothes, it would be logical to place the clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe. This action is likely to increase my score as it is a proper location for clothing.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and need to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. I see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa, a gray coat on the armchair, a brown suit on the end table, and a dictionary on the coffee table. Since I have previously placed clean clothing items in the wardrobe in the bedroom to gain points, it would be logical to take the clean checkered jumper and move it to the bedroom. 

Next action: take clean checkered jumper

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have identified a brown suit on the end table. The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. Since the brown suit is likely a piece of clothing, it would be appropriate to place it in the wardrobe, which is located in the bedroom to the west. Therefore, I should first take the brown suit from the end table, then proceed to the bedroom to place it in the wardrobe.

Next action: take brown suit
