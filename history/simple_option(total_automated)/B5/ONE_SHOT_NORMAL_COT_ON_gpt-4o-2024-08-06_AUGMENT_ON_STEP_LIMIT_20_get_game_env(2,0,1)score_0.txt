Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and have a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper in my inventory. These items are wet, so they should be placed in a clothes drier to dry them. However, there is no clothes drier in the kitchen. I need to find a room with a clothes drier to place these items properly. The only available direction to move is east, which leads to the backyard. I should explore further to find the laundry room or a place with a clothes drier.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard with a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper in my inventory. These items need to be dried, so the logical place to put them would be in a clothes drier. However, there is no clothes drier in the backyard. I need to find a clothes drier, which is likely located in the laundry room. To get there, I should explore the house by going through the open sliding patio door leading west.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard and I have a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper in my inventory. These items are wet, so they should be placed in a clothes drier to dry them. However, there is no clothes drier in the backyard. I need to find a location with a clothes drier. The only available direction to move is west, which leads to the kitchen. I should explore further to find a clothes drier.

Next action: go west
