Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and I have a clean white pullover in my inventory. The bedroom contains an opened wardrobe and a chest of drawers with a brown suit and a blue coat. There is no indication that the wardrobe or chest of drawers is the proper location for the clean white pullover.

The only exit from the bedroom is to the south, which might lead to another room where the pullover could be placed in its proper location.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their appropriate locations. In the current environment, I see a black coat on the sofa, a brown coat and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Coats and skirts typically belong in a wardrobe, which is likely located in the bedroom to the north. Therefore, I should first take these items so I can move them to the wardrobe.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and have a black coat in my inventory. There is a brown coat and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. Coats are typically stored in wardrobes or on coat racks, but since I am in the living room, I should focus on placing the black coat on a suitable supporter, like a coat rack, if available. However, since there is no coat rack mentioned in the living room, I should consider moving to a location where a coat rack might be present, such as a corridor or hallway. The only available direction to move is north, which might lead to a location with a coat rack.
