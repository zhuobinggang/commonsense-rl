2. The clean checkered jumper was previously placed on the sofa, which was incorrect, indicating it should be placed elsewhere.
3. The wardrobe in the bedroom is a suitable place for clean clothes, as demonstrated by the previous action of placing the clean plaid polo shirt there.
4. I should focus on taking items that are likely to be placed in the wardrobe, such as the clean checkered jumper or the clean white polo shirt, and move them to the bedroom.

The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table?

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a clean checkered jumper in my inventory. The living room has several pieces of furniture, but none of them seem appropriate for placing a clean checkered jumper. Previously, I successfully placed a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe in the bedroom, which increased my score. Therefore, it is likely that the wardrobe in the bedroom is the correct place for the clean checkered jumper as well.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have identified two items: a brown suit on the end table and a dictionary on the coffee table. Since I am in the living room, it is likely that the brown suit should be placed in the wardrobe in the bedroom, as clothing items are typically stored there. The dictionary, being a book, might belong on a bookshelf or similar location, but since the bookcase here is empty, it might be best to leave it for now. My goal is to take the brown suit to the bedroom and place it in the wardrobe to increase my score.

Next action: take brown suit

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
