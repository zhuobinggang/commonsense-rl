Consideration: I need to put items in their appropriate locations to increase my score. Currently, I have a brown coat and a black coat in my inventory. Coats are typically stored in wardrobes or closets, but since I am in the living room, I should look for a suitable place to put them. However, there is no wardrobe or closet in the living room. I should consider moving to a location where I can properly store these coats. The only available direction to move is north, which might lead me to a place with a wardrobe or closet.
