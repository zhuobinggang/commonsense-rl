A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What\'s that over there? It looks like it\'s a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone\'s already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn\'t a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand.

You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there\'s nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn\'t a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn\'t got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn\'t there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn\'t got anything on it. If you haven\'t noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it\'s a desk. Wow, isn\'t TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door?
