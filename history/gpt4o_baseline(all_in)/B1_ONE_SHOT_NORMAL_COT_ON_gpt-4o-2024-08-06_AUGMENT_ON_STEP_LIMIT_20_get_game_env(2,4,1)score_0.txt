Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their appropriate locations. Currently, I am in a bedroom with a pair of blue moccasins in my inventory. The environment has a nightstand with a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover, and a dressing table with a clean azure skirt. Since the blue moccasins are a type of footwear, they might belong in a wardrobe or on a nightstand, similar to the brown moccasins. However, since the wardrobe is empty, it might be a suitable place to store the blue moccasins.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. The blue moccasins were previously placed in the wardrobe, which was incorrect. Moccasins are typically worn on the feet, so they should be placed in a location associated with footwear, such as a shoe rack or similar area. However, since I am currently in the bedroom and there is no shoe rack here, I should first take the blue moccasins with me. Then, I can explore other rooms to find the appropriate place for them.

Consideration: The goal is to place items in their proper locations to improve the score. The blue moccasins are currently in the inventory, and they need to be placed in the correct location. Since the wardrobe was the wrong location, we should consider other options. Moccasins are typically worn on the feet, so placing them on the floor might be appropriate.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. The blue moccasins have already been placed incorrectly twice, so I should focus on other items for now. The clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover are likely to belong in a wardrobe or closet, but since the wardrobe here is empty, they might need to be moved to another room. The brown moccasins might belong in a shoe cabinet or similar location, which could be in another room. I should start by gathering items that are likely to be moved to another room.

Consideration: The clean azure skirt should be placed in a location where clean clothes are typically stored. In a bedroom setting, this would likely be a wardrobe or a chest of drawers.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their correct locations. Currently, I am in the corridor, and I can see a clean white skirt on the coat hanger and a pair of clean white socks on the floor. The clean white socks should likely be placed in a wardrobe or a drawer, which might be in another room. The clean white skirt might also belong in a wardrobe or a drawer. I should first take the clean white socks, as they are on the floor and likely need to be placed somewhere appropriate.

Consideration: The goal is to place items in their correct locations to improve the score. The clean white socks are currently in the inventory, and the shoe cabinet has been identified as the wrong location for them. The hat rack, key holder, and umbrella stand are all empty, and the coat hanger currently holds a clean white skirt. Since socks are typically not hung on coat hangers or placed on key holders, the most logical place to try next would be the umbrella stand, as it is a container-like structure that could potentially hold socks.

Consideration: I need to find the proper location for the clean white socks and the clean white skirt to improve my score. The clean white socks are currently on the umbrella stand, which is not the correct location. The clean white skirt is on the coat hanger, but I need to determine if this is the correct location or if it should be moved elsewhere. Since I have already examined the clean white socks and know they are antiquated, I should focus on examining the clean white skirt to gather more information about its proper location.

Consideration: The goal is to place items in their correct locations to increase the score. The clean white socks have been placed in several incorrect locations already, so it's important to find the right spot. Since the shoe cabinet is empty and typically used for storing socks, it might be worth trying to place the socks there again. However, since it was previously incorrect, it might be better to try a different location. The coat hanger currently has a clean white skirt, which suggests it might not be the right place for socks. The hat rack, key holder, and umbrella stand have also been tried without success. Given the options, it might be worth trying the shoe cabinet again, as it is the most logical place for socks.

Consideration: The goal is to place items in their correct locations to improve the score. The current environment is the corridor, and the inventory contains a pair of clean white socks. The previous attempts to place the socks in the shoe cabinet and on the umbrella stand were incorrect. The hat rack, key holder, and coat hanger are potential places to try. Since the hat rack is typically used for hanging items, it might be a suitable place for the socks.

Next action: put clean white socks on hat rack

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. The clean white socks are currently on the hat rack, which is not the right position. I should take them and find a more suitable place for them. The clean white skirt is on the coat hanger, which might be the correct place for it, but I should examine it to be sure. Since I have been moving items around without success, I should focus on examining the environment and items to gather more information before making further moves.

Consideration: I need to find the proper location for the clean white socks and the clean white skirt to improve my score. The clean white socks are currently on the hat rack, which is not the correct location. The clean white skirt is on the coat hanger, but I need to determine if that's the right place for it. Since I have already tried placing the clean white socks in various locations in the corridor without success, I should consider moving to another room to find the correct location. The only available exit is to the north, which might lead to a room where these items belong.

Next action: go north
