Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You have come into a kitchen. Not the kitchen you'd expect. No, this is a kitchen. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a fridge. You can see a closed oven nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive.

You see a raw purple potato, a green apple and a cookbook on the counter. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it.

There is a chopped roasted carrot and a red hot pepper on the floor.
