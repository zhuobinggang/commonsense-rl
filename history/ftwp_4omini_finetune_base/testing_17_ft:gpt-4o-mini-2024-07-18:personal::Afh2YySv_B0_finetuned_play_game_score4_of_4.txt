Inventory: You are carrying: a yellow bell pepper a raw yellow potato a black pepper
Current environment: -= Kitchen =- You find yourself in a kitchen. An ordinary one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building. You see an open fridge here. The fridge contains a block of cheese, a white onion, a green bell pepper and a red onion. You make out an oven, so there's that. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you can see a cookbook. Huh, weird. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can make out a red hot pepper and a knife. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You make out a stove. But the thing is empty. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience!
