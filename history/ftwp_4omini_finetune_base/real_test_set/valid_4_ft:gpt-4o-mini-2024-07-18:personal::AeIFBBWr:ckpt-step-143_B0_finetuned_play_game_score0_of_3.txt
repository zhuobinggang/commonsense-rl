Current environment: -= Kitchen =- Look around you. Take it all in. It's not every day someone gets to be in a kitchen. An open fridge, which looks conventional, is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You make out an oven. Oh, great. Here's a table. On the table you can make out a cookbook. Suddenly, you bump your head on the ceiling, but it's not such a bad bump that it's going to prevent you from looking at objects and even things. You scan the room, seeing a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a knife. Classic TextWorld. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.
