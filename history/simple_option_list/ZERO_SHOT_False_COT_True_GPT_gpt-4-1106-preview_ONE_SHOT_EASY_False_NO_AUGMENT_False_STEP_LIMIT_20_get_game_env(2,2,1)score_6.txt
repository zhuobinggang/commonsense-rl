Consideration: The clean white pullover in the inventory likely belongs in the wardrobe or the chest of drawers, as these are typical storage places for clothing in a bedroom. The wardrobe is empty, which suggests that it might be the intended location for the pullover. The chest of drawers already contains a brown suit and a blue coat, so it may not be the right place for the pullover. Placing the pullover in the wardrobe should increase the score if it is the correct location.

Consideration: The chest of drawers in the bedroom likely serves as the proper storage location for clothing items such as suits and coats. Since the chest of drawers already contains a brown suit and a blue coat, it would be logical to assume that any similar items should be placed there as well. The wardrobe has already been used to store a clean white pullover, which suggests it is also a storage space for clothing. However, since the wardrobe is mentioned separately from the chest of drawers, it may be intended for different types of clothing or for items that are hung rather than folded.
