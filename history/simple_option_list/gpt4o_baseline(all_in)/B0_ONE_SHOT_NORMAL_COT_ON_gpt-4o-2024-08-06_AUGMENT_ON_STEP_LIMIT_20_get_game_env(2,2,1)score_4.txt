Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. Currently, I am in the bedroom with an opened wardrobe and an opened chest of drawers. The wardrobe contains a clean white pullover, which I have already placed correctly. The chest of drawers contains a brown suit and a blue coat. Typically, suits and coats are stored in wardrobes, so I should consider moving them there. However, I need to check if the wardrobe has enough space for these items. Since I can't directly check the wardrobe's capacity, I should first take one of the items from the chest of drawers and attempt to place it in the wardrobe.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. Currently, I am in the living room, and I see several items that might need to be moved to their appropriate places. The black coat on the sofa and the brown coat on the armchair are likely not in their correct locations. Coats are typically stored in a wardrobe or on a coat rack. The clean teal skirt and the clean gray polo shirt might belong in a wardrobe. I should start by taking one of these items so I can move it to its proper location.

Consideration: The black coat needs to be placed in its proper location to improve the score. The bookcase is not the correct location for the black coat, as indicated by the previous wrong position message. The armchair currently has a brown coat and a clean teal skirt, which suggests it might be a place for coats. However, the wardrobe is likely the correct location for coats, but it is not accessible from the current room. The best course of action is to move the black coat to a temporary location that makes sense within the living room context, such as the armchair, which already has a coat on it.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their correct locations. Currently, I am in the living room, and I see a black coat, a brown coat, and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, as well as a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Since coats and skirts are typically stored in a wardrobe, I should take them to a room with a wardrobe. The clean gray polo shirt might also belong in a wardrobe. My next step should be to take one of these items so I can move it to the correct location.

Consideration: I need to find the correct location for the black coat to improve my score. Since the bookcase and armchair were incorrect, I should try placing the black coat on the sofa or coffee table. However, since the sofa is described as comfy and empty, it might be a better place for the coat. Additionally, I should consider the possibility that the black coat might belong in another room, but I will try the sofa first.

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is already organized with the black coat, blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover, and the chest of drawers is empty, it seems that everything in the bedroom is in its proper place. To improve my score, I should explore other areas to find items that need to be placed correctly. The only exit from the bedroom is to the south, which leads to the living room. I should go there to look for items that might need organizing.

Next action: go south
