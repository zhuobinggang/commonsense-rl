Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their appropriate locations. In the laundry room, wet items should be placed in the clothes drier, and dirty items should be placed in the washing machine. Currently, I see several items that need to be sorted: a wet blue jumper on the work table, wet plaid socks on the suspended shelf, wet white panties on the floor, and several dirty items including a dirty brown pullover, a dirty magenta skirt, a dirty striped polo shirt, and a dirty striped pullover. 

The first step is to take one of the wet items and place it in the clothes drier. Since the wet blue jumper is on the work table, it is easily accessible.

Next action: <fill in>


Consideration: I am currently in the laundry room, and I have a dirty striped pullover in my inventory. The washing machine already contains a dirty magenta skirt, a dirty brown pullover, and a dirty striped polo shirt. The clothes drier contains a pair of wet white panties, a pair of wet plaid socks, and a wet blue jumper. Since the dirty striped pullover is dirty, it should be placed in the washing machine to be cleaned. This action will likely increase my score, as placing items in their correct locations typically does.

Next action: insert dirty striped pullover into washing machine
