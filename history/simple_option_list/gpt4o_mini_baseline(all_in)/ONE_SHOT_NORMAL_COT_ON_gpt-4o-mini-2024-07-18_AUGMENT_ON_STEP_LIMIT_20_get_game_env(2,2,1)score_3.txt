Consideration: The brown suit has been previously identified as being in the wrong position, and the chest of drawers is empty. Since the wardrobe already contains a blue coat and a clean white pullover, it would be more appropriate to place the brown suit in the chest of drawers, which is currently empty. This will improve the score by putting the brown suit in its proper location.

Since the chest of drawers is empty, it may not be the right place for the brown suit either. The blue coat and clean white pullover are already in their proper locations.
