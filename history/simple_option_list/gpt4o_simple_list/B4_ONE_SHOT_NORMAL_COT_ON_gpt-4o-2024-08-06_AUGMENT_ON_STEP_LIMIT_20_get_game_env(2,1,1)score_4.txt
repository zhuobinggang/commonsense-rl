Currently, I am in the living room, and I have already placed the clean plaid polo shirt on the armchair, which was incorrect. I should consider moving items to their appropriate locations. The clean checkered jumper on the sofa and the clean white polo shirt on the floor might need to be placed elsewhere, possibly in a bedroom or closet. The brown suit on the end table might belong in a closet or wardrobe. Since I have the option to go west, I should explore that area to see if it has a more suitable location for these items.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a clean plaid polo shirt and a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and carrying a clean white polo shirt. The living room has an armchair with a clean plaid polo shirt and a gray coat on it, a side table, a TV stand, an end table with a brown suit, and a coffee table with a dictionary. The clean white polo shirt should likely be placed in a wardrobe, which is typically found in a bedroom. I should go to the bedroom to find a wardrobe to place the clean white polo shirt in.

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a clean plaid polo shirt, a clean white polo shirt and a clean checkered jumper. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
