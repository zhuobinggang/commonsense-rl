Consideration: Since I am currently in the bedroom and there is nothing in my inventory, I should first look for an item to take. The wardrobe contains a clean plaid polo shirt, but I have already placed it in the correct location. The rest of the room appears to be empty, so I should explore other areas to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available exit is to the east, which leads to the living room.

Consideration: I need to identify the items in the living room and determine their proper locations to increase my score. The items I see are a clean checkered jumper on the sofa, a gray coat on the armchair, a brown suit on the end table, a dictionary on the coffee table, and a clean white polo shirt on the floor. Typically, clothing items like the jumper, coat, suit, and polo shirt should be placed in a wardrobe or closet, which is likely in the bedroom. The dictionary might belong on a bookshelf or a study table, but since the bookcase here is empty, it might be better placed elsewhere.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a gray coat in my inventory. The living room has various pieces of furniture, but none of them seem appropriate for placing a coat. The gray coat would likely belong on a hat rack or in a wardrobe, which are typically found in a corridor or bedroom. Since I have already placed other clothing items in the wardrobe in the bedroom, it would be logical to place the gray coat there as well. Therefore, I should move to the bedroom to put the gray coat in the wardrobe.

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: Since the bedroom is already organized with all the clean clothes in the wardrobe, and there are no items left to place in the bedroom, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available exit is to go east, which will take me to the living room. I should go there to look for more items to organize.

Next action: go east



Task: You are a experienced text game player, your goal is put things in there proper locations and improve your score.

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have identified two items: a brown suit on the end table and a dictionary on the coffee table. Since I have been placing clothing items in the wardrobe in the bedroom, it would be logical to take the brown suit and put it in the wardrobe. The dictionary, being a book, might belong on a bookshelf or a similar location, but since the bookcase here is empty, it might be worth considering taking it as well. However, I should focus on one item at a time to ensure I am placing them correctly.

Next action: take brown suit
