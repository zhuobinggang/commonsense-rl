Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and I have some milk in my inventory. The kitchen has several items, but most of them are empty or irrelevant to my current task. The dishwasher contains a wet white jumper, which I previously placed there incorrectly. I need to find the correct location for the milk in my inventory to improve my score. The fridge is empty, which is unusual, and it seems like a logical place to store milk.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and I need to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. The dishwasher contains a wet white jumper, which is not in the correct location. The wet white jumper should be placed in a clothes drier, which is likely not in the kitchen. I should take the wet white jumper from the dishwasher and find a clothes drier to put it in. Additionally, there is a dirty pot on the dining table and a dirty cake slice on the counter, which might need to be cleaned or placed in a washing area. However, my immediate focus should be on correcting the location of the wet white jumper.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and I need to find items that are out of place and put them in their proper locations to improve my score. From the description of the kitchen, I can see a dirty pot on the dining table and a dirty cake slice on the counter. These items should likely be cleaned or placed in a location where they can be cleaned, such as the dishwasher. Since the dishwasher is empty, I can start by taking the dirty pot and putting it in the dishwasher.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and my inventory is empty. The kitchen contains a fridge, a kitchen cupboard, a dishwasher, a trash can, an oven, a dining table, a ladderback chair, a counter, a stove, and a dining chair. The fridge contains milk, the kitchen cupboard contains a clean pot, and the dishwasher contains a dirty cake slice and a dirty pot. Since my goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve my score, I should focus on organizing the items in the kitchen. The clean pot is already in the kitchen cupboard, which is the right place for it. The dirty cake slice and dirty pot are in the dishwasher, which is also appropriate. The fridge contains milk, which is correct. There are no other items in the kitchen that need to be moved. Therefore, I should explore other areas to find items that need to be placed correctly.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and my inventory is empty. The backyard has a BBQ with a wooden spoon on it, a clothesline with a wet white jumper and a wet azure skirt, an empty patio chair, an empty patio table, and an empty workbench. Since the clothesline already has wet clothes on it, I should focus on the wooden spoon on the BBQ. The wooden spoon likely belongs in the kitchen, which is west of my current location. Therefore, I should take the wooden spoon from the BBQ and then move to the kitchen to find its proper location.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard and have a wooden spoon in my inventory. The backyard has a clothesline, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench, but none of these seem like appropriate places for a wooden spoon. The sliding patio door leads west to the kitchen, which is a more suitable location for kitchen utensils like a wooden spoon. Therefore, I should head back to the kitchen to find a proper place for the wooden spoon.

Next action: go west
