Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory. There are several items in the living room, including a clean checkered jumper on the sofa, a gray coat on the armchair, a brown suit on the end table, a dictionary on the coffee table, and a clean white polo shirt on the floor. Since I am trying to put things in their proper locations to improve my score, I should consider where these items might belong. The clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory might belong in a wardrobe or closet, but I don't see one here. The dictionary might belong on a bookshelf, but the bookcase here is empty. The clean white polo shirt on the floor should probably be picked up first, as it is not in a proper location.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe in the bedroom already contains a gray coat, a clean checkered jumper, a clean plaid polo shirt, and a clean white polo shirt, which are all in their proper location. The chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, dark carpet, desk, and dressing table are all empty. Since there is nothing else to organize in the bedroom, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available exit is to the east, which leads to the living room.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have identified two items: a brown suit on the end table and a dictionary on the coffee table. Since I am trying to put things in their proper locations to improve my score, I should consider where these items might belong. A brown suit is likely to belong in a wardrobe, which is typically found in a bedroom. The dictionary might belong on a bookshelf or in a study area, but since I don't have access to such a location right now, I should focus on the brown suit first. I need to take the brown suit and then move to a location where I can place it properly.

Inventory: You are carrying:  a dictionary
Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a dictionary in my inventory. The living room has a wastepaper basket, which is a container. Since dictionaries are typically stored on bookshelves or in bookcases, and there is no such option here, the wastepaper basket might be the closest option available to place the dictionary. However, since the wastepaper basket is empty, it might not be the right place for a dictionary. I should consider moving to another room where a more appropriate location for a dictionary might be available.

Next action: go west

The wardrobe contains a brown suit, a gray coat, a clean checkered jumper, a clean plaid polo shirt and a clean white polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom and carrying a dictionary. The bedroom has a wardrobe, a chest of drawers, a bed, a desk chair, a nightstand, a dark carpet, a desk, and a dressing table. The wardrobe is already filled with clothes, and the chest of drawers is empty. The dictionary should be placed in a location where books are typically stored, such as a desk or a nightstand. Since the nightstand is standard and empty, it would be a suitable place to put the dictionary.

Next action: put dictionary on nightstand
