Consideration: Since the bedroom environment description does not mention any objects out of place or any specific items that need to be interacted with, and the wardrobe has already been used to store the clean plaid polo shirt, there are no immediate actions to take within the bedroom to improve the score.

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper on the sofa might be out of place, as typically clothing is not stored on furniture in a living room. The gray coat on the armchair is likely also misplaced for the same reason. The brown suit on the end table seems out of place as well, as end tables are not usually used for storing clothing. The dictionary on the coffee table might be in the right place, as coffee tables often hold books. The clean white polo shirt on the floor is definitely out of place and should be picked up.

Consideration: The clean white polo shirt in the inventory likely belongs in a wardrobe or a drawer, which is not present in the living room. The living room contains various items that may need to be repositioned, such as the clean checkered jumper on the sofa, the gray coat on the armchair, and the brown suit on the end table. These items typically belong in a wardrobe or closet. However, since the wardrobe is not in the living room, the best course of action is to explore other rooms to find the correct location for the white polo shirt and potentially for the other items as well.

Consideration: To determine the next action, I need to assess the current environment and inventory. The bedroom contains various pieces of furniture, but none of them currently have items on them that need to be organized or moved. Since my inventory is empty, I should look for an item that is out of place and can be picked up. However, the description of the bedroom does not mention any such items. Therefore, the logical step would be to explore another room to find items that need to be organized.

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper on the sofa might belong in a wardrobe, as it is a piece of clothing. The gray coat on the armchair also seems out of place and likely belongs in a wardrobe or on a coat rack. The brown suit on the end table is another item of clothing that should be stored properly, possibly in a wardrobe. The dictionary on the coffee table might belong on a bookcase or in a study area. To improve the score, we should start by picking up one of these items and placing it in its proper location.

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper in the inventory likely belongs in a wardrobe, similar to the previous actions taken with the clean plaid polo shirt and the clean white polo shirt. Since there is no wardrobe in the living room, the next logical step would be to find a wardrobe, which is typically located in a bedroom. The last known location of a wardrobe was to the west, in the bedroom.

Next action: go west

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a clean checkered jumper, a clean white polo shirt and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: To determine the next action, I need to assess the current environment and inventory. The bedroom contains various furniture items, but none of them currently have objects on them that need to be organized or moved. Since my inventory is empty, I should look for an object that needs to be placed in its proper location. However, the description of the bedroom does not mention any objects out of place. Therefore, the logical step is to explore another area where there might be objects to interact with.

Next action: go east
