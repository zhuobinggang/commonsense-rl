Current environment: -= Bedroom =-I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong. You start to take note of what's in the room.You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean plaid blazer, a clean green dress, a clean blue bra and a pair of black gloves. Look over there! a chest of drawers. The chest of drawers is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bed. On the bed you can make out a checkered duvet. You see a dark carpet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You see a desk chair. You see a gray blanket on the desk chair. You see a nightstand. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a nightstand in a room. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. However, the dressing table, like an empty dressing table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the dressing table.

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Another room: Unknown
Current environment: -= Bedroom =-I never took you for the sort of person who would show up in a bedroom, but I guess I was wrong. You start to take note of what's in the room.You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean red T-shirt, a clean plaid blazer, a clean green dress, a clean blue bra and a pair of black gloves. Look over there! a chest of drawers. The chest of drawers is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bed. On the bed you can make out a gray blanket and a checkered duvet. You see a dark carpet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You see a desk chair. But the thing is empty. You see a nightstand. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a nightstand in a room. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. However, the dressing table, like an empty dressing table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the dressing table.
