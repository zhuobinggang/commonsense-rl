Another room: -= Bedroom =- You find yourself in an empty bedroom. There's a wardrobe with a clean plaid pullover and an azure skirt inside. Nearby, an open chest of drawers holds a pair of clean white socks. A large bed sits empty, and a desk chair is also bare. The dark carpet has nothing on it. Leaning against the wall, you accidentally press a secret button, revealing a nightstand that is also empty. A dressing table and a desk in the room are both devoid of items. You can exit through an open entranceway to the south.
Environment: -= Corridor =- You find yourself in a corridor. There's an open shoe cabinet with a pair of brown moccasins and a pair of blue moccasins inside.

An exit is to the north, with no door blocking the way.
