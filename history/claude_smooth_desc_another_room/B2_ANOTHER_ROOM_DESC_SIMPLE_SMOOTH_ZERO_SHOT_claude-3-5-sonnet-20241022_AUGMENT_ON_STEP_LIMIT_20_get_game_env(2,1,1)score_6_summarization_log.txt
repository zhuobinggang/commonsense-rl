As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

-= Bedroom =- You are in a typical bedroom. There's a large open wardrobe with a gray coat, a white polo shirt, a brown suit, and a plaid polo shirt. A chest of drawers stands empty, and the light flickers briefly. You spot a large bed, but it's bare. A usual desk chair sits nearby, also empty. The standard nightstand has nothing on it, and the dark carpet is unremarkable. There's a desk and a dressing table, both empty. To exit, head east.

-= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a clean checkered jumper, a gray coat, a clean white polo shirt, a brown suit and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand.

The environment description:
-= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Livingroom =- You are in a familiar living room. It feels ordinary, but everything seems empty. There's a wastepaper basket, but it's empty. The bookcase is also empty. You find a sofa, but it's vacant too. An intriguing smell leads you to a grey carpet, which is bare. There's an armchair, but it's just as empty. A side table and a TV stand also lack items. You accidentally bump into an end table, which is empty as well. There's a coffee table with a dictionary on it. If you want to explore, you can go west; the entranceway is clear.

-= Livingroom =- You are in a familiar living room. Everything seems empty and uninviting. There's a wastepaper basket, but it's empty. The bookcase is also empty. You find a sofa, but it's bare. An intriguing smell leads you to a grey carpet, which is also empty. There's an armchair, but nothing on it either. A side table and a TV stand are both empty as well. You stumble onto an end table, which is also devoid of items. There's a coffee table, but it's empty too. Frustrated, you notice an entranceway to the west that isn't blocked by a door.
