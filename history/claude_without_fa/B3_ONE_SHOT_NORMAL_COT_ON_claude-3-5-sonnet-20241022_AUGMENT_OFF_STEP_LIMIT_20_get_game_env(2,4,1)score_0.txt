Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A pair of blue moccasins in our inventory
   - Brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Clean plaid pullover on the nightstand
   - Clean azure skirt on the dressing table

2) From the example walkthrough, we learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Clean clothes likely go in wardrobe or drawers
   - Shoes/moccasins might have a specific place

3) Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory, and there's a wardrobe and chest of drawers available, we should try storing them properly.

4) The wardrobe seems like a more logical place for shoes than a chest of drawers.

Consideration: Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory and they're likely meant to be stored, let's try putting them in the wardrobe first.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe (storage for clothes/shoes)
   - A dressing table (for clothes)
   - A nightstand with brown moccasins and clean plaid pullover
   - A dressing table with clean azure skirt

2) The goal is to put things in their proper locations:
   - Shoes typically go in the wardrobe
   - We already put blue moccasins in the wardrobe successfully
   - There are brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Shoes don't belong on a nightstand

3) Following the pattern of the previous successful action:
   - We put blue moccasins in wardrobe and got a point
   - Therefore, putting the brown moccasins in the wardrobe would likely also be correct

4) Next logical action:
   - Take the brown moccasins from the nightstand first
   - Then in the next turn we can put them in the wardrobe

Consideration: Since shoes belong in the wardrobe, and we need to move the brown moccasins there, we should first take them from the nightstand.

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

   - There's already a pair of blue moccasins in the wardrobe
   - Wardrobe is a proper storage place for shoes

4) Best course of action:
   - Since I'm holding brown moccasins and wardrobes are proper storage for shoes, I should put the brown moccasins in the wardrobe

Consideration: The wardrobe is the proper storage location for shoes, and I'm currently holding brown moccasins. Putting them in the wardrobe would likely improve the score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - Clean clothes (plaid pullover, azure skirt)
   - A wardrobe that already has moccasins in it
   - A chest of drawers that's empty

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture
   - The wardrobe is already being used for shoes
   - The empty chest of drawers would be a logical place for clean clothes

3) Therefore:
   - We should focus on putting the clean clothes away
   - The chest of drawers is the most appropriate location
   - We need to first collect the clean items

4) To start this process:
   - We should first take one of the clean items
   - Both the plaid pullover and azure skirt need to be moved
   - We can start with either one

Consideration: The clean plaid pullover is on the nightstand and needs to be stored properly. Taking it would be the first step toward putting it in the chest of drawers.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean plaid pullover
2) Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A wardrobe (contains shoes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - A clean azure skirt on dressing table
   - Various furniture pieces

3) Considering proper storage:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in drawers or wardrobes
   - The wardrobe already has shoes in it
   - The chest of drawers is empty and is typically meant for storing clothes

4) Based on the example walkthrough:
   - Putting items in their proper storage locations increases the score
   - Clean clothes should go in storage furniture

5) Therefore:
   - The clean plaid pullover should go in the chest of drawers since it's a proper storage location for clean clothes

Consideration: The most logical action is to put the clean plaid pullover in the chest of drawers, as this is a proper storage location for clean clothing items.

   - Put moccasins in wardrobe
   - Put clean plaid pullover in chest of drawers
5. The clean azure skirt on the dressing table needs to be properly stored to improve score

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Reasoning: Taking the skirt is the first step to properly storing it. After taking it, we can then put it in an appropriate storage location (likely the chest of drawers) in the next action.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean azure skirt
2) In the example walkthrough, clean clothes typically go into storage furniture like chest of drawers or wardrobe
3) Looking at the environment:
   - There's a wardrobe (currently has moccasins)
   - There's a chest of drawers (currently has a clean plaid pullover)
4) Since the chest of drawers already contains clean clothes (the pullover), it seems to be the appropriate storage for clean clothes
5) The wardrobe seems to be for shoes since it contains moccasins

Consideration: The clean azure skirt should go in the chest of drawers with the other clean clothing item, following the pattern of organizing similar items together.

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into chest of drawers

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe containing shoes (blue and brown moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers containing clothes (clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover)

2) From the example walkthrough, we can learn that:
   - Clothes generally belong in specific storage furniture
   - Proper placement increases the score

3) Current state:
   - All items seem to be in appropriate places already:
     * Shoes (moccasins) are in the wardrobe, which is appropriate for footwear
     * Clean clothes (skirt and pullover) are in the chest of drawers, which is appropriate for clothing storage

4) Consideration:
   - Since all items are already in their proper locations
   - No dirty items need washing
   - No wet items need drying
   - All items are stored in appropriate furniture

5) Conclusion:
   - There's no obvious improvement to be made in terms of item placement
   - We should explore other areas to find more items to organize

Next action: go south

The best action is to explore other areas since everything in this room is already properly stored.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items and storage locations
2. The key items I see are:
   - clean white skirt (on coat hanger)
   - clean white socks (on floor)
3. From previous experience:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in chest of drawers
   - We saw a chest of drawers in the room to the north
4. To maximize score, we should:
   - Pick up items that aren't in their proper place
   - Move them to their correct storage locations
5. Since we can only do one action at a time, we should start by collecting the items
6. The white skirt is a clean clothing item, so it should eventually go in the chest of drawers

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning: This is a good first step because:
- The skirt is clean and should be stored properly
- We'll need to take it before we can move it to the chest of drawers
- After this, we can go north and put it in the chest of drawers
- This will help improve our score when we place it correctly

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently in a corridor with a clean white skirt in my inventory
2) I also see clean white socks on the floor
3) Looking at previous successful actions in the example:
   - Clean clothes typically go in chest of drawers
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer
   - Hats go on hat rack

4) Considerations:
   - The clean white skirt is similar to the clean azure skirt from earlier, which went into the chest of drawers
   - The chest of drawers is in the room to the north
   - The clean white socks on the floor should probably also go in the chest of drawers
   - I should handle one item at a time

5) Therefore:
   - I should first go north to access the chest of drawers
   - Then I can put away the clean white skirt
   - After that, I can come back for the socks

Next action: go north

This will get me to the room with the chest of drawers where I can properly store the clean white skirt.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean white skirt
2) Looking at the environment, there are storage furniture pieces:
   - wardrobe (contains shoes)
   - chest of drawers (contains clothes)
   - bed, desk, etc. (not proper storage)

3) Analyzing patterns:
   - Previously, clean clothes (skirt, pullover) were put in chest of drawers
   - Shoes (moccasins) were put in wardrobe

4) Since I'm holding a clean white skirt:
   - It's a clothing item, not shoes
   - It's clean, like the other items in the chest of drawers
   - The chest of drawers already contains similar items (clean azure skirt)

5) Therefore, the proper location for a clean white skirt would be the chest of drawers

Consideration: Based on the pattern of previous successful actions and the nature of the item, the clean white skirt should go in the chest of drawers with other clean clothing items.

Next action: insert clean white skirt into chest of drawers

You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe with moccasins
   - A chest of drawers with clean clothes
   - Various empty furniture pieces

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobe
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer
   - Hats go on hat racks

3) Current state:
   - The shoes (moccasins) are already in the wardrobe
   - The clean clothes are already in the chest of drawers
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place

4) Therefore:
   - There's nothing left to organize in this room
   - We should explore other rooms to find more items to organize

Consideration: Since everything in this room is already in its proper place, we should explore other areas of the house to find more items that need organizing.

Next action: go south

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see clean white socks on the floor
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like chest of drawers
3. From previous actions, I know there's a bedroom to the north with a chest of drawers
4. The socks are clean, so they should be stored properly, not left on the floor
5. Taking the socks would be the first step to properly storing them
6. Other actions like examining things or closing cabinets won't help improve the score
7. The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning: Taking the clean white socks is the first necessary step to properly store them. Once we have them, we can then go north to the bedroom and put them in the chest of drawers where clean clothes belong. This follows the pattern we've seen in previous successful actions where picking up items and storing them properly earned points.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying clean white socks and need to put them in their proper location

2) Looking at the available locations in the corridor:
- shoe cabinet
- hat rack
- key holder
- umbrella stand
- coat hanger

3) Considering what makes logical sense:
- Socks are typically stored with other footwear
- The shoe cabinet would be the most appropriate place for socks
- Other locations (hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, coat hanger) are not meant for storing socks

4) From the example walkthrough, we can see that:
- Clothing items should go in their logical storage places
- Proper placement increases the score

5) Therefore, the most logical action would be to put the socks in the shoe cabinet, as this is where footwear-related items belong.

Consideration: The shoe cabinet is the most appropriate storage location for socks since it's related to footwear storage.

Next action: insert clean white socks into shoe cabinet

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:

2. The socks are already in a proper storage location (shoe cabinet)
3. Other storage locations (hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, coat hanger) are empty
4. Moving items to improper locations won't improve score
5. The socks are already in their proper location (shoe cabinet), so taking them out would be counterproductive
6. Looking at previous actions, we've been putting things in their proper places and getting points
7. Since everything is currently in its proper place in this room, we don't need to move anything

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since there's nothing left to organize in the corridor (the socks are already properly stored), and we have a path to the north, the best action is to explore the other room to find more items to organize. Taking the socks out of their proper storage would be counterproductive to our goal of improving the score.

2) Looking at the previous actions:
   - We've already put shoes in the wardrobe
   - We've already put clothes in the chest of drawers
   - All items we've handled so far have been placed in appropriate storage

3) Current state:
   - All visible items appear to be in their correct locations
   - Shoes are in wardrobe (appropriate for shoes)
   - Clothes are in chest of drawers (appropriate for clothing)

4) Possible next steps:
   - Since everything is already in its proper place, we should explore other areas
   - The description mentions we can go south to a corridor
   - We might find more items to organize in other rooms

Consideration: Since all items in this room are already properly stored, and we've already explored the corridor before (from action history), we should continue exploring to find more items to organize.

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a pair of brown moccasins and a pair of blue moccasins. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a clean white skirt, a clean azure skirt and a clean plaid pullover. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe with moccasins
   - A chest of drawers with clean clothes
   - Various empty furniture pieces

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer
   - Clean clothes go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobe
   - Hats go on hat rack

3) Current state:
   - The shoes (moccasins) are already in the wardrobe
   - The clean clothes are already in the chest of drawers
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place in this room

4) Consideration:
   - Since everything in this room is already in its proper place
   - We should explore other rooms to find more items to organize
   - The corridor to the south might lead to other rooms with items

Next action: go south

Reasoning: Since everything in the current room is properly stored, we should explore other areas of the house to find more items that need to be organized. The south exit leads to a corridor which might connect to other rooms with items we can organize.



Task: You are a experienced text game player, your goal is put things in there proper locations and improve your score.

Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a pair of clean white socks, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, there are clean white socks in the shoe cabinet
2. From the example walkthrough, I know that putting things in their proper locations increases the score
3. The socks are already in a proper location (shoe cabinet), as it makes sense to store socks with shoes
4. Taking them out would be counterproductive since they're already in the right place
5. Looking at the other actions, none of them would help improve the score since they're either examining items or movement
6. Closing the cabinet would be a good action since we want to keep the stored items secure

Next action: close shoe cabinet

This is the best action because:
- The socks are already properly stored
- Closing storage furniture after using it is proper organization
- Other available actions won't improve our score or help with organization

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations (coat hanger, hat rack, shoe cabinet, etc.)
3. Currently all storage locations appear empty
4. The shoe cabinet is closed, and there might be items inside that need to be properly organized
5. In previous actions, we've been organizing various clothing items
6. Since we can't see what's in the closed shoe cabinet, opening it would be a logical first step to check if there are any items that need to be relocated

Next action: open shoe cabinet

Reason: Opening the shoe cabinet will reveal if there are any items inside that need to be organized. This is a necessary first step before we can determine what needs to be moved where. We can't properly organize items if we can't see them all.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see clean white socks in the shoe cabinet
2. From the example walkthrough, I see that putting items in their proper locations increases the score
3. Looking at my inventory, I'm not carrying anything
4. The clean white socks are already in the shoe cabinet, which seems to be their proper location
5. I previously put them there (Action 13) and got a point for it
6. Since the socks are already in their correct place, taking them out would be counterproductive
7. None of the other actions would help improve the score since the other storage locations (hat rack, key holder, etc.) are empty and I don't have any items to put in them
8. Going north might lead me to find more items to organize

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since all items in the current room are already in their proper places, the best action is to explore other rooms to find more items that need to be organized. Going north leads back to the bedroom where we might find more items to sort.
