Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A pair of blue moccasins in our inventory
   - Brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Clean plaid pullover on the nightstand
   - Clean azure skirt on the dressing table

2) From the example walkthrough, we learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Clean clothes likely go in wardrobe or drawers
   - Shoes/moccasins might go in specific storage

3) Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory, and there's a wardrobe and chest of drawers available, we should try storing them properly.

4) The wardrobe seems more appropriate for shoes than a chest of drawers.

Consideration: Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory and they're presumably clean (since they're not described as dirty), we should try putting them in the wardrobe for proper storage.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe (storage for clothes/shoes)
   - A dressing table (for clothes)
   - A nightstand with brown moccasins and clean plaid pullover
   - A dressing table with clean azure skirt

2) From the example walkthrough, we learn that:
   - Clean clothes should be stored properly
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobes
   - Clothes typically go in appropriate storage furniture

3) Currently:
   - The blue moccasins are already in the wardrobe (good)
   - The brown moccasins are on the nightstand (should be in wardrobe)
   - The clean clothes are not properly stored

4) Priority:
   - Since shoes should be in the wardrobe, and we have brown moccasins on the nightstand, we should move those to the wardrobe first.

Consideration: The brown moccasins are shoes that should be stored in the wardrobe, just like the blue moccasins. Taking them from the nightstand is the first step to properly storing them.

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

   - Wardrobe is a proper storage place for shoes

4) Best course of action:
   - Since I'm holding brown moccasins and wardrobes are proper storage for shoes, I should put the brown moccasins in the wardrobe
   - This follows the same pattern as the example where items were put in their proper places

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - Clean clothes (plaid pullover, azure skirt)
   - A wardrobe that already has moccasins in it
   - A chest of drawers that's empty

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture
   - The wardrobe is already being used for shoes
   - The empty chest of drawers would be a logical place for clean clothes

3) Therefore:
   - We should focus on putting the clean clothes away
   - The chest of drawers is the most appropriate location
   - We need to first collect the clean items

4) To start this process:
   - We should first take one of the clean items
   - Both the plaid pullover and azure skirt need to be moved
   - We can start with either one

Consideration: The clean plaid pullover is on the nightstand and needs to be stored properly. Taking it would be the first step toward organizing it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean plaid pullover
2) Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A wardrobe (contains shoes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - A clean azure skirt on dressing table
   - Various furniture pieces

3) Considering proper storage:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in drawers or wardrobes
   - The wardrobe already has shoes in it
   - The chest of drawers is empty and is typically meant for storing clothes

4) Based on the example walkthrough:
   - Putting items in their proper storage locations increases the score
   - Clean clothes should go in storage furniture

5) Therefore:
   - The clean plaid pullover should go in the chest of drawers since it's a proper storage location for clean clothes

Consideration: The most logical action is to put the clean plaid pullover in the chest of drawers, as this is a proper storage location for clean clothing items.

4. The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table, which might not be its proper storage location
5. Since it's a clean clothing item, it should probably go in the chest of drawers (similar to how the clean plaid pullover was stored)

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Reasoning: This is the first step to move the clean azure skirt to a more appropriate storage location. Once we have it in our inventory, we can then put it in the chest of drawers in the next action.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean azure skirt
2) In the example walkthrough, clean clothes typically go into storage furniture like chest of drawers or wardrobe
3) Looking at the environment:
   - There's a wardrobe (currently has moccasins)
   - There's a chest of drawers (currently has a clean plaid pullover)
4) Since the chest of drawers already contains clean clothes (the pullover), it seems to be the appropriate storage for clean clothes
5) The wardrobe seems to be for shoes since it contains moccasins

Consideration: The clean azure skirt should go in the chest of drawers with the other clean clothing item, following the pattern that clean clothes belong in the chest of drawers.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe containing shoes (blue and brown moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers containing clothes (clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover)

2) From the example walkthrough, we can learn that:
   - Clothes generally belong in specific storage furniture
   - Proper placement increases the score

3) Current state:
   - All items seem to be in appropriate places already:
     * Shoes (moccasins) are in the wardrobe, which is appropriate for footwear
     * Clean clothes (skirt and pullover) are in the chest of drawers, which is appropriate for clothing storage

4) Consideration:
   - Since all items are already in their proper locations
   - No dirty items need washing
   - No wet items need drying
   - All items are stored in appropriate furniture

5) Conclusion:
   - There's no obvious improvement to be made in terms of item placement
   - We should explore other areas to find more items to organize

Next action: go south

The best action is to explore other areas since everything in this room is already properly stored.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items and storage locations
2. The key items I see are:
   - clean white skirt (on coat hanger)
   - clean white socks (on floor)
3. From previous experience:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in chest of drawers
   - We saw a chest of drawers in the room to the north
4. To maximize score, we should:
   - Pick up the clean items
   - Move them to appropriate storage
5. Best to handle one item at a time
6. Since the white skirt is clean, we should take it first to put it in the chest of drawers

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning:
- This is the first step to properly storing the clean white skirt
- After taking it, we can go north and put it in the chest of drawers
- Then we can come back for the socks
- This follows the pattern we've seen before where clean clothes go in the chest of drawers

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently in a corridor with a clean white skirt in my inventory.

2) Looking at the environment and available actions, I see several storage options:
   - shoe cabinet (for shoes)
   - hat rack (for hats)
   - coat hanger (for clothes/coats)
   - umbrella stand (for umbrellas)
   - key holder (for keys)

3) I also see clean white socks on the floor that could be picked up.

4) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes generally go on coat hangers or in drawers
   - Hats go on hat racks
   - The goal is to put items in their logical places

5) Since I'm holding a clean white skirt, and skirts are clothing items, the most logical place would be the coat hanger.

Consideration: The clean white skirt is a clothing item, and the coat hanger is specifically designed for hanging clothes. This would be the most appropriate location for the skirt.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A clean white skirt on a coat hanger
   - Clean white socks on the floor
   - Various storage furniture (shoe cabinet, hat rack, etc.)

2) From the example walkthrough, we can learn:
   - Clean clothes typically go in proper storage
   - Socks should probably go in a drawer or cabinet
   - Skirts can go on coat hangers (as shown in previous action history)

3) Current state analysis:
   - The white skirt is already on the coat hanger (proper location)
   - The white socks are on the floor (improper location)
   - The shoe cabinet is empty and could be a proper place for socks

4) Priority:
   - Since the white skirt is already properly placed, we don't need to move it
   - The socks on the floor need to be picked up and stored properly

Consideration: The most urgent task is to deal with the socks on the floor, as items on the floor are typically not in their proper place. We should first pick them up before finding their proper storage location.

   - Socks are related to footwear
   - The shoe cabinet is a proper storage place for socks
   - In the example walkthrough, items were put in their logical places
4. The shoe cabinet is currently empty and open
5. Putting items in their proper place increased the score in the example walkthrough

Next action: insert clean white socks into shoe cabinet

This action makes the most sense because:
- It puts the socks in a logical storage location
- It's likely to increase the score based on the pattern from the example
- It helps organize the environment properly

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have:
   - clean white skirt on coat hanger
   - clean white socks in shoe cabinet
   - empty hat rack, key holder, and umbrella stand

2. From the example walkthrough and previous actions:
   - Clean clothes typically go in chest of drawers or on coat hangers
   - Socks typically go in shoe cabinet

3. Current state analysis:
   - The clean white skirt is already on a coat hanger (proper location)
   - The clean white socks are already in the shoe cabinet (proper location)
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place already

4. Since everything in this room is already in its proper location, we should explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since all items in the current room are already in their proper places, we should explore the north exit to find more items that might need organizing. This is the most logical next step to continue improving our score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe containing moccasins (shoes)
   - A chest of drawers containing clothes (skirt and pullover)
   - These items seem to be in their proper locations already:
     * Shoes belong in wardrobe
     * Clothes belong in chest of drawers

2) Looking at the previous actions:
   - We've already organized several items
   - The items currently in the wardrobe and chest of drawers were put there through previous actions
   - Those placements increased our score

3) Current state analysis:
   - All visible items appear to be in their proper storage locations
   - Shoes in wardrobe
   - Clothes in chest of drawers
   - Nothing seems out of place

4) Possible next steps:
   - Since everything is properly stored, we could explore other rooms for more items to organize
   - The "go south" option would let us explore more areas

Consideration: Since all items in this room are already in their proper storage locations, the best action would be to explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have:
   - clean white socks in shoe cabinet
   - clean white skirt on coat hanger
2. From previous actions, we know:
   - We already put clean white socks in shoe cabinet (Action 11)
   - We already put clean white skirt on coat hanger (Action 9)
3. Since both items are already in their proper locations (as evidenced by the previous score increases), we don't need to move them.
4. The shoe cabinet is open, and generally, it's good practice to close storage furniture after using it.
5. We've completed organizing the items in this area, so closing the cabinet would be a proper finishing touch.

Next action: close shoe cabinet

Reasoning: Since all items are already in their correct places and we've been moving items in and out of the shoe cabinet, it makes sense to close it now. This is a common action that might increase the score or at least maintain good order in the game environment.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several storage locations: hat rack, umbrella stand, key holder, coat hanger, and shoe cabinet
2. Currently there's only one item in the room - a clean white skirt on the coat hanger
3. From the action history, we've already organized several items, including putting a clean white skirt on the coat hanger
4. The clean white skirt is already in its proper location (coat hanger is appropriate for hanging clothes)
5. The shoe cabinet is closed, but we've already put clean white socks in it earlier
6. Since everything visible is already in its proper place, we should explore other areas for items to organize
7. There's an exit to the north that leads to the bedroom, which might have more items to organize

Next action: go north

Reasoning:
- Since everything in the current room is properly stored, and we've already dealt with the visible items, the best action is to explore other areas to find more items that need organizing.
- The north exit leads to the bedroom, which we've been to before and might have new items to organize.
- Moving to a new room will allow us to find more opportunities to improve our score by organizing items.

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out a closed shoe cabinet. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. On the coat hanger you can see a clean white skirt.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have several storage locations (hat rack, shoe cabinet, coat hanger, etc.)

2) Currently there's a clean white skirt on the coat hanger, which seems to be a proper location for hanging clothes.

3) Looking at the previous actions, we already:
   - Put socks in the shoe cabinet
   - Put the white skirt on the coat hanger (and then took it and put it back)

4) The goal is to improve score by putting things in their proper places.

5) Since the white skirt is already on the coat hanger (which is a proper place for it), moving it would likely not improve our score.

6) The shoe cabinet is closed, but since we already put socks in it earlier, there might be more items to organize inside.

Consideration: Opening the shoe cabinet would allow us to see if there are any items inside that need to be properly organized. This is a logical next step since we can't see what's inside while it's closed.

Next action: open shoe cabinet

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several storage locations: shoe cabinet, hat rack, coat hanger, umbrella stand, and key holder.
2. We have two items visible: clean white skirt (on coat hanger) and clean white socks (in shoe cabinet).
3. From the example walkthrough, we learn that:
   - Clothes generally go in appropriate storage locations
   - Socks belong in shoe cabinet
   - Skirts can go on coat hangers
4. The clean white skirt is already on the coat hanger (proper location)
5. The clean white socks are already in the shoe cabinet (proper location)
6. Since both items are already in their proper locations, the best action would be to close the shoe cabinet to keep things tidy.

Next action: close shoe cabinet

Reasoning: Both items are already in their proper locations, so the best action is to close the shoe cabinet since it's currently open. This maintains organization and follows proper storage practices.

4. The clean white skirt is already on a coat hanger, which seems like an appropriate place for it
5. Opening the shoe cabinet might reveal more items to organize
6. The shoe cabinet was previously shown to contain clean white socks, which we already organized

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since we've already checked and organized items in this corridor (including confirming the white skirt is properly placed on the coat hanger), and there's nothing else obvious to organize here, we should explore the connected room to find more items to organize. The north exit leads to the bedroom, which might contain more items that need proper placement.

The wardrobe contains a pair of brown moccasins and a pair of blue moccasins. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a clean azure skirt and a clean plaid pullover. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe containing shoes (blue and brown moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers containing clothes (clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover)

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes generally belong in proper storage furniture
   - The current locations seem appropriate (shoes in wardrobe, clothes in drawers)

3) Current state analysis:
   - All items appear to be in their proper locations already
   - Shoes are in the wardrobe (appropriate for footwear)
   - Clean clothes are in the chest of drawers (appropriate for clothing)

4) Since everything is already in its proper place, we should:
   - Keep things organized
   - Close any open storage to maintain tidiness

Consideration: Since the chest of drawers is mentioned as "open" and contains properly stored items, the most appropriate action would be to close it to maintain organization.

Next action: close chest of drawers
