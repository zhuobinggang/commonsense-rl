Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A pair of blue moccasins in our inventory
   - Brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Clean plaid pullover on the nightstand
   - Clean azure skirt on the dressing table

2) From the example walkthrough, we learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Clean clothes likely go in wardrobe or drawers
   - Shoes/moccasins might have a specific place

3) Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory, and there's a wardrobe and chest of drawers available, we should try storing them properly.

4) The wardrobe seems like a more logical place for shoes than a chest of drawers.

Consideration: Since we have blue moccasins in our inventory and they're likely meant to be stored, let's try putting them in the wardrobe first.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe (storage for clothes/shoes)
   - A dressing table (for clothes)
   - A nightstand with brown moccasins and clean plaid pullover
   - A dressing table with clean azure skirt

2) From the example walkthrough, we learn that:
   - Clean clothes should be stored properly
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobes
   - Clothes typically go in appropriate storage furniture

3) Currently:
   - The blue moccasins are already in the wardrobe (good)
   - The brown moccasins are on the nightstand (should be in wardrobe)
   - The clean clothes are not properly stored

4) Priority:
   - Since shoes should be in the wardrobe, and we have brown moccasins on the nightstand, we should move those to the wardrobe first.

Consideration: The brown moccasins are shoes that should be stored in the wardrobe, just like the blue moccasins. Taking them from the nightstand is the first step to properly storing them.

   - Wardrobe is a proper storage place for shoes

4) Best course of action:
   - Since I'm holding brown moccasins and wardrobes are proper storage for shoes, I should put the brown moccasins in the wardrobe
   - This follows the same pattern as the example where items were put in their proper places

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - Clean clothes (plaid pullover, azure skirt)
   - A wardrobe that already has moccasins in it
   - A chest of drawers that's empty

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture
   - The wardrobe is already being used for shoes
   - The empty chest of drawers would be a logical place for clean clothes

3) Therefore:
   - We should focus on putting the clean clothes away
   - The chest of drawers is the most appropriate storage location
   - We need to first collect the clean items

4) To start this process:
   - We should first take one of the clean items
   - Both the plaid pullover and azure skirt need to be moved
   - We can start with either one

Consideration: The clean plaid pullover is on the nightstand and needs to be stored properly. Taking it would be the first step toward organizing it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean plaid pullover
2) Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A wardrobe (contains shoes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - A clean azure skirt on dressing table
   - Various furniture pieces

3) Considering proper storage:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in drawers or wardrobes
   - The wardrobe already has shoes in it
   - The chest of drawers is empty and is typically meant for storing clothes

4) Based on the example walkthrough:
   - Putting items in their proper storage locations increases the score
   - Clean clothes should go in storage furniture

5) Therefore:
   - The clean plaid pullover should go in the chest of drawers since it's a proper storage location for clean clothes

Consideration: The most logical action is to put the clean plaid pullover in the chest of drawers, as this is a proper storage location for clean clothing items.

   - The only item not stored properly is the clean azure skirt on the dressing table

4) Therefore:
   - The clean azure skirt should be picked up and stored in a proper storage location
   - Since it's a clean clothing item, it likely belongs in the chest of drawers

Consideration: The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table and needs to be properly stored. The first step would be to take it.

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean azure skirt
2) In the example walkthrough, clean clothes typically go into storage furniture like chest of drawers or wardrobe
3) Looking at the environment:
   - There's a wardrobe (currently has moccasins)
   - There's a chest of drawers (currently has a clean plaid pullover)
4) Since the chest of drawers already contains clean clothes (the pullover), it seems to be the appropriate storage for clean clothes
5) The wardrobe seems to be for shoes since it contains moccasins

Consideration: The clean azure skirt should go in the chest of drawers with the other clean clothing item, following the pattern of organizing similar items together.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe containing shoes (blue and brown moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers containing clothes (clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover)

2) From the example walkthrough, we can learn that:
   - Clothes generally belong in specific storage furniture
   - Proper placement increases the score

3) Current state analysis:
   - The shoes are in the wardrobe, which is appropriate for footwear
   - The clean clothes are in the chest of drawers, which is appropriate for clothing

4) Everything seems to be in its proper place already:
   - Shoes in wardrobe ✓
   - Clean clothes in chest of drawers ✓

5) Since everything is properly stored, we should explore other areas to find more items to organize.

Consideration: Since all items in this room are already in their proper locations, the best action would be to explore another area through the available exit.

Next action: go south

You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items and storage locations
2. The key items I see are:
   - clean white skirt (on coat hanger)
   - clean white socks (on floor)
3. From previous experience:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in chest of drawers
   - We saw a chest of drawers in the room to the north
4. To maximize score, we should:
   - Pick up items that aren't in their proper place
   - Move them to their correct storage locations
5. Since we can only do one action at a time, we should start by collecting the items
6. The white skirt is a clean clothing item, so it should eventually go in the chest of drawers

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning: This is a good first step because:
- The skirt is clean and should be stored properly
- We'll need to take it before we can move it to the chest of drawers
- After this, we can go north and put it in the chest of drawers
- This will help improve our score when we place it correctly

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently in a corridor with a clean white skirt in my inventory
2) I also see clean white socks on the floor
3) Looking at previous successful actions in the example:
   - Clean clothes typically go in chest of drawers
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer
   - Hats go on hat rack

4) Considerations:
   - The clean white skirt is similar to the clean azure skirt from earlier, which went into the chest of drawers
   - The chest of drawers is in the room to the north
   - The clean white socks on the floor should probably also go in the chest of drawers
   - I should handle one item at a time

5) Therefore:
   - I should first go north to access the chest of drawers
   - Then I can put away the clean white skirt
   - After that, I can come back for the socks

Next action: go north

This will get me to the room with the chest of drawers where I can properly store the clean white skirt.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean white skirt
2) Looking at the environment, there are two storage locations:
   - A wardrobe (containing shoes/moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers (containing clothes like skirt and pullover)
3) From the example walkthrough, I can learn that:
   - Clothes (dresses, skirts, pullovers) typically go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobes
4) The white skirt I'm holding is a clothing item, not footwear
5) Therefore, the proper location for the clean white skirt would be the chest of drawers, similar to where the clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover are stored

Consideration: Since the clean white skirt is a clothing item, it should go in the chest of drawers with the other clothes to improve the score.

The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe with moccasins
   - A chest of drawers with clean clothes
   - Various empty furniture pieces

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobe
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer

3) Current state:
   - The shoes (moccasins) are already in the wardrobe
   - The clean clothes are already in the chest of drawers
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place in this room

4) Therefore:
   - Since everything in this room is already in its proper place
   - We should explore other rooms to find more items to organize
   - The only direction available is south

Consideration: Since everything in this room is already properly stored, we should explore other rooms to find more items that need organizing.

Next action: go south

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see clean white socks on the floor
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like chest of drawers
3. From previous actions, I know there's a bedroom to the north with a chest of drawers
4. The socks are clean, so they should be stored properly, not left on the floor
5. Taking the socks would be the first step to properly storing them
6. Other actions like examining things or closing cabinets won't help improve the score
7. The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning:
- This is the first necessary step to properly store the socks
- After taking them, we can then move north to the bedroom and put them in the chest of drawers
- This follows the pattern we've seen with other clean clothes being stored in the chest of drawers
- Other available actions won't contribute to improving our score

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying clean white socks and need to put them in their proper location

2) Looking at the available locations in the corridor:
- shoe cabinet
- hat rack
- key holder
- umbrella stand
- coat hanger

3) Considering what makes logical sense:
- Socks are typically stored with other footwear
- The shoe cabinet would be the most appropriate place for socks
- Other locations (hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, coat hanger) are not meant for storing socks

4) From the example walkthrough, we can see that:
- Clothing items should go in their logical storage places
- Proper placement increases the score

5) Therefore, the most logical action would be to put the socks in the shoe cabinet, as this is where footwear-related items belong.

Consideration: The shoe cabinet is the most appropriate storage location for socks since it's related to footwear storage.

Next action: insert clean white socks into shoe cabinet

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have a shoe cabinet with clean white socks in it
2. The socks are already in a proper storage location (shoe cabinet)
3. Other storage locations (hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, coat hanger) are empty
4. Taking items from their proper storage locations would not improve score
5. Closing the cabinet would be a reasonable action since we're done with it
6. Going north leads back to the bedroom, but we've already organized items there

Next action: close shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
- The socks are already properly stored in the shoe cabinet
- When we're done putting things in storage, it's good practice to close containers
- None of the other actions would improve our score or help organize items
- Taking the socks out would be counterproductive since they're already properly stored

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations (coat hanger, hat rack, key holder, shoe cabinet, umbrella stand)
2. Currently all storage locations are empty
3. The shoe cabinet is closed, and there might be items inside that need to be properly organized
4. From previous actions, we've been organizing clothes and accessories
5. Opening the shoe cabinet would let us see if there are any items inside that need to be moved to their proper locations
6. Other actions like examining furniture or going north don't directly help with organizing items

Next action: open shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
- Opening the shoe cabinet is the most logical next step because:
  1. It's currently closed, so we can't see what's inside
  2. In previous actions, we've dealt with organizing various clothing items
  3. There might be items inside that need to be moved to more appropriate locations
  4. This action could potentially lead to opportunities to improve our score by organizing items correctly

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see a shoe cabinet with clean white socks in it
2. From the example walkthrough, I know that:
   - Clean clothes should go in appropriate storage
   - Socks specifically belong in the shoe cabinet
3. The socks are already in the shoe cabinet, which is their proper location
4. Opening and closing the cabinet won't improve score
5. Going north might reveal more items to organize
6. Taking the socks out would be counterproductive since they're already in their correct place

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since the socks are already properly stored in the shoe cabinet, and there's nothing else to organize in the corridor, the best action is to explore the other room (north) to find more items that might need proper storage. This follows the pattern from previous successful actions where we needed to move between rooms to complete tasks.

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a pair of brown moccasins and a pair of blue moccasins. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a clean white skirt, a clean azure skirt and a clean plaid pullover. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: <fill in>

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe with moccasins
   - A chest of drawers with clean clothes
   - Various empty furniture pieces

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer
   - Clean clothes go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically go in wardrobe
   - Hats go on hat rack

3) Current state:
   - The shoes (moccasins) are already in the wardrobe
   - The clean clothes are already in the chest of drawers
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place

4) Consideration:
   - Since everything appears to be in its proper place already
   - There's no dirty or wet clothes to deal with
   - All items are already stored correctly
   - The only remaining action might be to close storage furniture for tidiness

Next action: close wardrobe

Reasoning: Since all items are in their proper places, the next logical step would be to ensure everything is properly closed and tidy. The wardrobe containing the shoes is still open, so closing it would be appropriate.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A closed wardrobe
   - A chest of drawers containing clean clothes
   - Various other furniture pieces

2) From previous actions:
   - We've already put some shoes in the wardrobe
   - We've put clean clothes in the chest of drawers
   - The wardrobe is currently closed

3) Analyzing the items:
   - The clean clothes (skirt, pullover) are already in proper storage (chest of drawers)
   - The wardrobe is closed and might contain more space for clothes

4) Best next steps:
   - Since the wardrobe is closed and we previously put shoes in it, we should check if there's space for more items
   - Opening the wardrobe would let us see if we can organize more items there

Consideration: The wardrobe is currently closed and we should check its contents to see if we can organize more items properly. Opening it is a logical next step before we can make any decisions about moving items.

Next action: open wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A wardrobe with shoes (brown and blue moccasins)
   - A chest of drawers with clothes (clean white skirt, clean azure skirt, clean plaid pullover)

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes generally belong in proper storage furniture
   - Putting items in their correct locations increases the score

3) Current state analysis:
   - The shoes are already in the wardrobe (proper place for shoes)
   - The clean clothes are already in the chest of drawers (proper place for clothes)
   - Everything seems to be in its proper place already

4) Since everything appears to be in its correct location, the best action would be to:
   - Close any open storage furniture to ensure everything is properly stored
   - The chest of drawers is currently open

Consideration: Since everything is in its proper place, the next logical step would be to close the open storage furniture. The chest of drawers is open and contains properly stored clothes, so closing it would be appropriate.

Next action: close chest of drawers

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment and available actions, I notice:
   - There are moccasins (both blue and brown) in the wardrobe
   - The chest of drawers is closed
   - Previously, we've been putting clean clothes in the chest of drawers
   - Shoes typically belong in a shoe cabinet, which we saw in the corridor

2) Analyzing the previous actions:
   - We've been organizing items by putting them in their proper locations
   - Clean clothes went into the chest of drawers
   - Shoes went into the shoe cabinet
   - The shoe cabinet is in the corridor

3) Therefore:
   - The moccasins should go to the shoe cabinet in the corridor
   - To do this, we first need to take one pair of moccasins
   - We can start with either pair, let's go with the blue ones

4) The most logical next step is to take the blue moccasins so we can later move them to the shoe cabinet.

Consideration: Taking the blue moccasins from the wardrobe is the first step to properly storing them in the shoe cabinet, which should increase our score.

Next action: take blue moccasins from wardrobe
