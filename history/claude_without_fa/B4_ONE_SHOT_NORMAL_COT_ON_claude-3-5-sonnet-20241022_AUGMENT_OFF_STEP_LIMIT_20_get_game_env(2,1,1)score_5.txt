Inventory: You are carrying:  a clean plaid polo shirt
Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm in a bedroom and have a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory
2) Clean clothes typically belong in either:
   - A wardrobe
   - A chest of drawers
3) Both the wardrobe and chest of drawers are currently empty
4) Looking at the example walkthrough:
   - Clean/dry clothes were put away in storage furniture
   - Dirty clothes went to washing machine
   - Wet clothes went to dryer
   - Hats went on hat rack
5) Since this is a clean shirt, it should be stored properly in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
6) The wardrobe is described as "large" which suggests it's meant for hanging clothes like shirts

Consideration: Based on these observations, the most logical action would be to put the clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, as shirts are typically hung up rather than folded in drawers.

Next action: insert clean plaid polo shirt into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2. Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be a proper storage location for clothes
3. From the previous action history:
   - I just put the clean plaid polo shirt INTO the wardrobe and got a point
4. This suggests:
   - The clean plaid polo shirt is already in its correct location
   - Moving it would likely reduce the score
5. Looking at other possible actions:
   - Most are just examine actions which won't improve score
   - Moving east might lead to new opportunities

Next action: go east

Reasoning: Since the clean plaid polo shirt is already properly stored (as evidenced by getting a point), and there's nothing else to organize in this room, the best action is to explore the next room for more opportunities to improve the score.

You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several clothing items and a dictionary that could potentially be moved to their proper locations:
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - clean white polo shirt on floor
   - gray coat on armchair
   - dictionary on coffee table

2) From the previous action history, I know:
   - We just put a clean plaid polo shirt into a wardrobe
   - We're in the livingroom now

3) General rules for organization:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in a wardrobe
   - Books typically belong in a bookcase
   - The room has an opened bookcase that's currently empty

4) Priority analysis:
   - The dictionary is out of place on the coffee table
   - The bookcase is empty and available
   - Books are typically stored in bookcases
   - This would be a logical first step

Consideration: The dictionary is clearly out of place on the coffee table, and there's an empty bookcase right there in the room. Moving the dictionary to the bookcase would be a logical first step to organize the room.

Next action: take dictionary from coffee table

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the items in the room:
   - Dictionary (in inventory)
   - Clean checkered jumper (on sofa)
   - Gray coat (on armchair)
   - Brown suit (on end table)
   - Clean white polo shirt (on floor)

2. Looking at the possible storage locations:
   - Bookcase (empty)
   - Wardrobe (in another room, where we previously put a polo shirt)
   - Wastepaper basket (not suitable for clothes or books)

3. Analyzing what would make sense:
   - Dictionary belongs in a bookcase (books go in bookcases)
   - Clean clothes likely belong in the wardrobe (where we put the other clean shirt)
   - The dictionary is already in our inventory, so we can act on it immediately

4. Based on previous score increases:
   - Putting items in their logical places increases the score
   - The dictionary's logical place is the bookcase

Next action: insert dictionary into bookcase

This action makes the most sense as it puts the dictionary in its proper storage location (a bookcase is meant for books), and will likely increase our score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items of clothing and furniture:
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean white polo shirt on floor
   - dictionary in bookcase

2) From the previous example walkthrough, I learned that:
   - Clean clothes should go in the wardrobe
   - Books should go in the bookcase

3) The dictionary is already in the bookcase where it belongs (we put it there in action 3), so that's good.

4) All the clothing items appear to be clean (they have "clean" in their name or no status), so they should go in the wardrobe.

5) To move items to the wardrobe, we need to:
   - First take the item
   - Go west (where the wardrobe likely is)
   - Put the item in the wardrobe

6) Therefore, we should start by picking up one of the clean clothing items.

Consideration: Since we need to pick up all clean clothes eventually to put them in the wardrobe, we can start with any of them. Let's start with the clean checkered jumper from the sofa.

   - Go back west where the wardrobe is to store it properly
   - Then come back for the clean white polo shirt

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper should be stored in the wardrobe like the clean plaid polo shirt was. Since the wardrobe is in the room to the west, I should go there first.

Next action: go west

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean checkered jumper, which is a piece of clothing
2) Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where I could put it
3) Since it's a clean piece of clothing, it should be stored properly
4) The wardrobe is a proper storage location for clean clothes
5) There's already a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, which suggests that's where clean clothes belong
6) Previous actions that put things in their proper place (like the dictionary in bookcase) earned points
7) Therefore, putting the clean jumper in the wardrobe should be the correct action to improve the score

Consideration: The wardrobe is the most appropriate storage location for clean clothing items, and putting things in their proper place has earned points in previous actions.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have a bedroom with various furniture including a wardrobe that contains two clean items.
2. From the example walkthrough, we can see that clean clothes belong in the wardrobe.
3. Looking at our action history, we've already put some clean items in the wardrobe (clean plaid polo shirt and clean checkered jumper).
4. The wardrobe is currently open and contains both clean items in their proper place.
5. Since the clean items are already in their correct location (the wardrobe), and we've already scored points for putting them there, the next logical step would be to close the wardrobe to keep the clothes protected.
6. Closing containers after using them is often good practice in text games.

Next action: close wardrobe

This action makes sense because:
1. All clean clothes are properly stored in the wardrobe
2. We've completed the storage tasks for this location
3. It's logical to close storage furniture after use
4. It might contribute to our score or at least maintain good organization

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2) Looking at the current environment:
   - I'm in a bedroom with various furniture
   - Most furniture appears empty
   - The wardrobe is closed and I previously put clean clothes in it
3) Analyzing the situation:
   - Wardrobes are meant for storing clothes
   - I've already successfully put clean clothes in the wardrobe
   - There might be more items to deal with inside other furniture
   - To see what's inside furniture, I need to open it first
4) Looking at previous actions:
   - I just closed the wardrobe
   - There might be more clothes to organize
5) Considering available actions:
   - Most examine actions will just give descriptions
   - Opening the wardrobe could reveal more items to organize

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is a key piece of furniture for storing clothes, and it's currently closed, I should open it to check if there are more items to organize or space for more clothes.

Next action: open wardrobe

1) Looking at the environment, we're in a bedroom with various furniture pieces.

2) In the wardrobe, there are two items:
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean plaid polo shirt

3) Since these are clean clothes and they're already in the wardrobe (which is the proper storage location for clean clothes), we don't need to move them.

4) Looking at the other furniture (bed, chest of drawers, desk, etc.), they're all empty and there's nothing that needs to be organized.

5) Since everything in this room is already in its proper place, and we can't improve our score by moving the already properly stored clothes, the logical next step would be to explore other rooms to find items that need organizing.

Consideration: The best course of action is to explore other rooms to find more items that need to be put in their proper places. Since we can't improve our score in this room, we should go east to check the next room.

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. The bookcase contains a dictionary. You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.There is a clean white polo shirt on the floor.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that might need to be put in their proper places:
   - clean white polo shirt on the floor
   - brown suit on the end table
   - gray coat on the armchair
   - dictionary in the bookcase

2. From previous experience in text games:
   - Clean clothes usually belong in a wardrobe
   - The dictionary is already in the bookcase (proper location)
   - Coats and suits typically belong in a wardrobe or closet

3. I know there's a bedroom to the west that has a wardrobe (from action history)

4. The clean white polo shirt is on the floor, which is definitely not its proper place. Since it's a clean clothing item, it should go in the wardrobe.

5. Priority should be given to items in improper places (like floor) first.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

Reasoning: 
- The clean white polo shirt is on the floor, which is the most improper location
- We can then take it to the wardrobe in the bedroom (west)
- This will likely improve our score when we put it in its proper place
- We should handle one item at a time, starting with the most obviously misplaced one

However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean white polo shirt, which is a clothing item
2) Looking at previous successful actions in the walkthrough:
   - Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe (like the clean checkered jumper)
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom
3) The bedroom is west of the current location
4) Therefore, I need to:
   - Go west to reach the bedroom
   - Then put the clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe

Looking at the available actions, the first step is to go west.

Consideration: I should go west to reach the bedroom where I can properly store the clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe, similar to how other clean clothes were stored there earlier.

Next action: go west

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently holding a clean white polo shirt
2) Looking at the environment, there's a wardrobe that already contains clean clothes (a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt)
3) The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes
4) From the example walkthrough, we can see that putting clean clothes in the wardrobe increases the score
5) Other furniture pieces (bed, desk, chair, etc.) are not proper storage locations for clothes
6) The wardrobe is already open, so I can put items in it directly

Consideration: Since I'm holding a clean white polo shirt, and the wardrobe is the proper storage location for clean clothes, I should put the polo shirt in the wardrobe to increase my score.

2) The wardrobe currently contains:
   - clean white polo shirt
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean plaid polo shirt
3) All these items are already in their proper location (wardrobe is the correct place for clean clothes)
4) Looking at our previous actions, we've been:
   - putting clean clothes into the wardrobe
   - putting books into bookcase
5) Since all items in view are already in their proper places, there's nothing more to organize here
6) We should explore other rooms to find more items to organize

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that might need to be put in their proper places:
   - a gray coat on the armchair
   - a brown suit on the end table
   - a dictionary in the bookcase

2. From these items:
   - The dictionary is already in the bookcase (proper location)
   - Coats and suits typically belong in a wardrobe
   - We know there's a wardrobe in the bedroom (west)
   - We've already put several clothing items in the wardrobe successfully

3. Since both the gray coat and brown suit need to go to the wardrobe, we should take one of them first.

4. The gray coat is on the armchair and the brown suit is on the end table - either would be a valid choice, but let's handle one at a time.

Next action: take gray coat from armchair

Reasoning: This will be the first step in moving the gray coat to its proper location in the wardrobe. After this, we can go west to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe, then come back for the brown suit.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a gray coat
2. Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where I could put the coat
3. From the game's logic and real-world common sense:
   - Coats typically belong in wardrobes or on coat racks
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
   - The coat is a piece of clothing, not a book or waste, so bookcase and wastepaper basket wouldn't be proper
4. I also see a brown suit on the end table, which is not its proper location either
5. Since I know the wardrobe is in the bedroom, I should head there first with the coat

Next action: go west

Reasoning: Going west to the bedroom is the best next action because:
1. That's where the wardrobe is located
2. The wardrobe is the proper storage location for the coat I'm carrying
3. None of the current location's storage options (bookcase, wastepaper basket, etc.) are appropriate for a coat
4. While there is a brown suit I could pick up, it's better to deal with one item at a time and complete the coat task first

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a gray coat that needs to be put away properly.

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage options:
   - A wardrobe (currently contains clean clothes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - Various surfaces (bed, desk, etc.)

3) Considering the previous successful actions in the game:
   - Clean clothes have been stored in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clothing items

4) The gray coat is a clothing item, so it should logically go in the wardrobe with the other clothes.

5) Previous actions that increased the score involved putting items in their proper storage locations (like clothes in wardrobe, dictionary in bookcase).

Consideration: The wardrobe appears to be the proper storage location for clothing items, and since the gray coat is a piece of clothing, putting it in the wardrobe should increase the score.

Next action: insert gray coat into wardrobe

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we're in a bedroom with several pieces of furniture
2) The wardrobe currently contains:
   - gray coat
   - clean white polo shirt
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean plaid polo shirt
3) All these items are already in their proper location (wardrobe is the correct storage for clothes)
4) We got points previously for putting these items in the wardrobe
5) Looking at the other furniture (bed, desk, chest of drawers, etc.), they're all empty
6) Since all clothes are already properly stored, we should explore other rooms to find more items to organize

Therefore:

Consideration: Since all clothes in the wardrobe are already properly stored and all other furniture is empty, we should explore the livingroom (east) to find more items that might need organizing.

Next action: go east

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. The bookcase contains a dictionary. You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items and storage locations
2. The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
3. I see a brown suit on the end table - clothing items typically belong in a wardrobe
4. I see a dictionary in the bookcase - it's already in its proper place
5. From previous actions, I know there's a wardrobe in the bedroom to the west
6. The brown suit is currently not in its proper location (end table)
7. Moving the brown suit to the wardrobe would likely increase the score

Next action: take brown suit from end table

Reasoning:
- This is the first step needed to move the brown suit to its proper location (wardrobe)
- After taking it, we can go west to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe
- This follows the pattern of previous successful actions where we moved clothing items to the wardrobe
- Other actions like examining items or closing containers won't help improve our score

Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a brown suit
2. Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where I could put the suit
3. From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can observe that:
   - Clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - Books go in bookcases
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
4. Since the brown suit is a clothing item, it should be stored in the wardrobe
5. The wardrobe is in the bedroom, which is to the west
6. None of the furniture in the current room (livingroom) would be appropriate for storing clothes

Next action: go west

Reasoning: Going west will take me to the bedroom where I can put the brown suit in its proper location (the wardrobe) to improve my score, similar to how I previously stored other clothing items like the clean white polo shirt and gray coat in the wardrobe.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a brown suit that needs to be stored properly.

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage options:
   - A wardrobe (currently contains clothes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - Various furniture pieces (bed, desk, etc.)

3) From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can observe:
   - Clean clothes and coats belong in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe has been used successfully for storing other clean clothing items
   - Each proper storage action has increased the score

4) The brown suit is a clean clothing item, similar to the other items already in the wardrobe (polo shirts, jumper, coat)

5) Therefore, the most logical action would be to store the brown suit in the wardrobe, as it's the proper storage location for clean clothing items.

Consideration: The wardrobe is the designated storage place for clean clothes, and putting the brown suit there should increase the score.

Next action: insert brown suit into wardrobe
