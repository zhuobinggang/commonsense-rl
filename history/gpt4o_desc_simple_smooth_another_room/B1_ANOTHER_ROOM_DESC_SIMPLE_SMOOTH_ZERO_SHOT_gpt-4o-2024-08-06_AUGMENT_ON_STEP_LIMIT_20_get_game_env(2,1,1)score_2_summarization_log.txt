As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual.

The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table?

-= Bedroom =- You are in a typical bedroom. There is a large closed wardrobe and a chest of drawers. The light flickers briefly. You spot a large bed, but it is empty. A usual desk chair sits in the room, also empty. There is a standard nightstand with nothing on it. A dark carpet covers the floor, and a desk by the wall is empty as well. A dressing table is present, but it too is empty. To exit, go east.

Task: Simplify the environment description.
The environment description:
-= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

-= Livingroom =- You are in a familiar living room. There's an empty wastepaper basket and an empty bookcase. A sofa with a clean checkered jumper sits in the room. You notice an intriguing smell coming from a grey carpet, which is also empty. An armchair holds a gray coat, and a side table is bare. The TV stand is empty too. You accidentally bump into an end table, which has a brown suit on it. There's a coffee table with a dictionary on it. You can go west; the entranceway is clear.

-= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see a closed wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
