Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: <fill in>

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean plaid polo shirt, which is a piece of clothing
2) Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or drawers
3) Looking at the environment, there are two main storage options:
   - A wardrobe
   - A chest of drawers
4) The wardrobe is described as "large" and is currently empty
5) Wardrobes are specifically designed for hanging and storing clothes
6) In previous examples, putting items in their proper locations increased the score

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is the most appropriate place for storing clothes and it's currently empty, inserting the clean plaid polo shirt into the wardrobe would be the most logical action to improve the score.

Next action: insert clean plaid polo shirt into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2. Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage for clean clothes
3. From the previous action (Action 0), I already put the clean plaid polo shirt INTO the wardrobe and got a point
4. Since the shirt is already in its correct location (wardrobe), I don't need to move it
5. Looking at other items in the room, they are all furniture pieces and can't be moved
6. The only direction available is east, which might lead to other rooms with items to organize

Next action: go east

Reasoning: Since everything in this room is already properly placed (the clean shirt is in the wardrobe), and there's nothing else to organize here, the best action is to explore other rooms by going east to find more items that need to be put in their proper locations.

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table?

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several clothing items:
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean white polo shirt on floor

2) From the previous successful action, I know:
   - clean clothes go in the wardrobe
   - the wardrobe is likely in another room

3) Since I'm in the livingroom and need to get to the wardrobe:
   - I need to collect clean clothes
   - I'll need to go west to get back to where the wardrobe was

4) Strategy:
   - First collect clean clothes
   - Then move to the room with wardrobe
   - Put clothes in wardrobe

5) Looking at the clean items, I should start picking them up one at a time.

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper is a clean clothing item that should go in the wardrobe. I should take it first since it's easily accessible on the sofa.

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from sofa

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current environment, we're in a bedroom with various furniture pieces.

2) From the action history, we've already:
   - Put a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe (scored a point)
   - Put a clean checkered jumper in the wardrobe (scored a point)

3) Both items are currently in their correct location (the wardrobe), as evidenced by the points we received.

4) Since both clean clothing items are already in their proper place (wardrobe), and we received points for these actions, we shouldn't move them.

5) Looking at the available actions, there's nothing else that would obviously improve our score:
   - The examining actions won't affect score
   - Closing furniture won't affect score
   - The clean clothes are already in their correct place

6) Since we've optimized this room and there's nothing else to improve score here, we should explore other areas for more opportunities.

Consideration: Since we've properly placed all items in this room and received points for them, we should explore another room to find more items to organize.

Next action: go east

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items that could potentially be put in proper locations:
- clean white polo shirt (on floor)
- brown suit (on end table)
- gray coat (on armchair)
- dictionary (on coffee table)

2) Based on the example walkthrough and previous actions:
- Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe (as shown by previous actions with the plaid polo shirt and checkered jumper)
- The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)

3) Since there's a clean white polo shirt on the floor, and we know clean clothes belong in the wardrobe:
- We should pick up the clean white polo shirt first
- Then we can go west to the bedroom to put it in the wardrobe

4) This follows the same pattern as the previous successful actions that increased the score.

Consideration: The clean white polo shirt is out of place on the floor, and as a clean clothing item, it should go in the wardrobe like other clean clothes we've seen.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean white polo shirt
2) From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes generally go in the wardrobe
   - We've already put other clean items (plaid polo shirt and checkered jumper) into the wardrobe
3) The wardrobe is in the bedroom, which is to the west
4) Other items in the room (brown suit, gray coat, dictionary) might need to be dealt with later, but first let's handle what's in our inventory
5) Since clean clothes belong in the wardrobe, and the wardrobe is in the bedroom, we should go west first

Consideration: We should focus on putting the clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe, which means we need to go to the bedroom first. The other items can be handled after we deal with what's in our inventory.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean white polo shirt

2) Looking at the environment, there's a wardrobe that already contains:
   - a clean checkered jumper
   - a clean plaid polo shirt

3) From the example walkthrough and previous actions:
   - Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe
   - Previous actions putting clean clothes in wardrobe increased the score

4) Pattern recognition:
   - Clean clothes → Wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothing items

5) Therefore:
   - I should put the clean white polo shirt into the wardrobe
   - This should increase my score like previous similar actions

Consideration: Since I have a clean clothing item (white polo shirt) and the wardrobe is the proper storage location for clean clothes, I should insert it into the wardrobe to improve my score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current environment, we're in a bedroom with several pieces of furniture.

2) The wardrobe currently contains:
   - clean white polo shirt
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean plaid polo shirt

3) From the previous actions and score increases, we can see that:
   - Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe
   - We've already put these items in the wardrobe and got points for it

4) Since all the clean clothes are already in their proper location (the wardrobe), and we got points for putting them there, there's no immediate action needed to improve the score.

5) The other furniture items (bed, desk, etc.) are all empty, and we don't have any items in our inventory.

6) We might need to explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Consideration: Since all clothes in the wardrobe are already properly placed (we got points for putting them there), and there are no other items to organize in this room, we should explore other areas to find more items that need proper placement.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that could potentially be moved:
   - brown suit on end table
   - gray coat on armchair
   - dictionary on coffee table

2. Based on previous text game experience:
   - Clothes typically belong in wardrobes or closets
   - Books typically belong in bookcases
   - The opened bookcase is currently empty

3. From the previous actions, we know:
   - There's a wardrobe in the bedroom (west)
   - We've been putting clean clothes in the wardrobe
   - The bookcase in this room is empty

4. Most logical next steps:
   - The dictionary should go in the bookcase since it's a book
   - The clothes (suit and coat) should probably go in the wardrobe

5. Since we're currently in the livingroom and the bookcase is right here, dealing with the dictionary first would be most efficient.

Next action: take dictionary from coffee table

Reasoning: This is the most efficient first step because:
1. The bookcase is in the same room
2. It's logical that books belong in bookcases
3. We can avoid unnecessary room transitions for now
4. We can then deal with the clothing items together afterward

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a dictionary
2) Looking at the environment, there's a bookcase which is currently empty
3) From common sense, dictionaries belong in bookcases
4) There are also other items in the room (brown suit, gray coat) but let's handle one thing at a time
5) Among all available actions, inserting the dictionary into the bookcase seems most logical since:
   - Dictionaries are books
   - Books belong in bookcases
   - Other locations like TV stand, coffee table, etc. aren't proper storage for books

Consideration: The most logical action is to put the dictionary in its proper place - the bookcase. This follows both common sense and typical text game patterns where items need to be placed in their most appropriate locations.

Next action: insert dictionary into bookcase



Task: You are a experienced text game player, your goal is put things in there proper locations and improve your score.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that might need to be put in their proper places:
   - brown suit on end table
   - gray coat on armchair
   - dictionary in bookcase

2. From previous actions, I know:
   - The dictionary is already in its proper place (it was just put there in Action 11)
   - Clothes typically belong in a wardrobe
   - We've been putting clean clothes in the wardrobe in the bedroom

3. Since both the brown suit and gray coat are clothing items, they likely belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom.

4. We can only carry one item at a time, so we need to choose one to start with.

5. The order doesn't matter much since both items need to go to the same place.

Next action: take brown suit from end table

Reasoning: I'll start with the brown suit. We'll need to take it, go west to the bedroom, and put it in the wardrobe. This should increase our score since we're putting things in their proper locations.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a brown suit
2. Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where I could put the suit
3. From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes go in wardrobe
   - Books go in bookcase
   - Hats go on hat rack
4. Since the brown suit is a clothing item, it should likely go in a wardrobe
5. I don't see a wardrobe in this room, but I know there's one in the bedroom
6. The bedroom is to the west of the current location

Next action: go west

Reasoning: 
- The brown suit needs to be stored in a wardrobe for proper organization
- The wardrobe is in the bedroom
- Therefore, I should first move to the bedroom (west) before trying to put the suit away
- This follows the pattern we've seen with other clean clothing items that were stored in the wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a brown suit
2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations:
   - wardrobe (contains clean clothes)
   - chest of drawers (empty)
   - bed
   - desk
   - desk chair
   - dressing table
   - nightstand

3) From the example walkthrough and previous actions:
   - Clean clothes go in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe already has clean clothes in it

4) The brown suit appears to be a formal piece of clothing, and based on common sense:
   - Suits typically belong in a wardrobe with other clothes
   - It's not something you'd put on a desk, chair, or nightstand

5) Since the wardrobe is already being used for clean clothes storage, this seems like the most logical place for the suit.

Consideration: The brown suit is a piece of clothing and should be stored with other clothes in the wardrobe, which is the proper storage location for clothing items.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current environment, we're in a bedroom with several pieces of furniture.

2) Looking at the items in the wardrobe:
   - brown suit
   - clean white polo shirt
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean plaid polo shirt

3) All these items are already in the wardrobe, and from previous actions we know:
   - We put them there ourselves
   - We got points for putting them there
   - Therefore, they are in their correct location

4) Looking at other furniture:
   - Most furniture is empty
   - No other items to move around

5) Since everything in view is either:
   - Already in its correct place (the clothes in wardrobe)
   - Empty furniture
   - Fixed room features

6) The logical next step would be to explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Consideration: Since all items in this room are already in their correct places, we should explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. The bookcase contains a dictionary. You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that might need to be put in their proper places:
   - a gray coat on the armchair
   - a dictionary in the bookcase (but we just put it there and got points)

2. From previous experience in text games:
   - Clothes typically belong in wardrobes
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
   - The gray coat is likely out of place on the armchair

3. The dictionary is already in its proper place (bookcase) since we just put it there and got points.

4. Therefore, the gray coat should be moved to the wardrobe in the bedroom.

Next action: take gray coat from armchair

Reasoning: This is the first step in moving the gray coat to its proper location (the wardrobe). After taking it, we'll need to go west to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe in the next actions.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a gray coat
2. Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces but no obvious storage for clothes
3. From the example walkthrough, I know clothes typically go in wardrobes
4. The bedroom (which is west) had a wardrobe where we previously put other clothing items
5. Since the coat is a clothing item, it should probably go in the wardrobe
6. None of the available actions in this room seem like the proper place for a coat
7. Therefore, we should head to the bedroom to access the wardrobe

Next action: go west

Reasoning: This will take us to the bedroom where we can put the gray coat in its proper location (the wardrobe) to improve our score, similar to how we handled the brown suit, clean white polo shirt, and other clothing items earlier.

The wardrobe contains a brown suit, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a gray coat that needs to be put somewhere proper.

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations:
   - A wardrobe (currently contains suits and clean clothes)
   - A chest of drawers (empty)
   - Various furniture surfaces

3) Analyzing the patterns from previous successful actions:
   - Clean clothes and suits have been put in the wardrobe (brown suit, clean polo shirts, clean jumper)
   - The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage for clothing items

4) The gray coat is a clothing item, similar to the brown suit and other clothing items that were successfully stored in the wardrobe.

5) Based on these patterns, the wardrobe appears to be the most logical proper location for the gray coat.

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is where other clothing items have been successfully stored and increased the score, it's most likely the proper location for the gray coat as well.

Next action: insert gray coat into wardrobe
