Consideration: I need to identify items that are not in their proper locations and move them to where they belong to increase my score. Currently, I am in the backyard, and I have some milk in my inventory. The backyard has a BBQ with a wooden spoon, a clothesline, a patio chair with a wet white jumper, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. The wet white jumper should be dried, so it should be moved to a clothes drier, but I don't have access to one here. The clean pot on the workbench might belong in a kitchen or storage area. The wooden spoon on the BBQ might belong in a kitchen. Since I have milk in my inventory, I should find a refrigerator or a place where milk is typically stored. 

Next action: go west (to explore other areas and find a suitable place for the milk or other items).





Command adjusted: go west (to explore other areas and find a suitable place for the milk or other items). -> None

Consideration: I need to identify any items in the kitchen that are not in their proper locations and move them to where they belong. The dirty cake slice is currently in the trash can, which is not the correct location. I should find the correct location for the dirty cake slice, which might be in another room. Since I have the option to go east, I should explore the next room to see if there is a more appropriate place for the dirty cake slice.

Next action: 4. go east

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and my inventory is empty. The backyard has a BBQ, a clothesline with a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. Since the clean pot is on the workbench, it might be more appropriate to place it in the kitchen where it belongs. To do this, I need to take the clean pot from the workbench and then move to the kitchen to place it in the correct location.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard and have a clean pot in my inventory. The clean pot should be placed in a location where clean kitchen items are typically stored. Since I have already placed a wooden spoon in the cutlery drawer in the kitchen, it would make sense to place the clean pot in the kitchen as well. Therefore, I should move to the kitchen to find an appropriate place for the clean pot.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a clean pot. The kitchen has a dishwasher that contains a dirty pot, which means the clean pot should not go there. The fridge already contains milk, and the cutlery drawer has a wooden spoon. The trash can has a dirty cake slice, which is not the right place for it. The clean pot should be placed in a location where clean kitchen items are typically stored, such as a cupboard or on a counter.

Next action: put clean pot in cupboard
