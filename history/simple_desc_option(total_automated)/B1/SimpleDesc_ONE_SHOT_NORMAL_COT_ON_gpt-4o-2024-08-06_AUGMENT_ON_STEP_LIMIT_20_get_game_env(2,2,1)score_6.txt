Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe already contains the black coat, blue coat, brown suit, and white pullover, which are in their proper location. The chest of drawers is empty, and the bed is also empty. Since I have no items in my inventory, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available direction to move is south, which leads to the living room. I should go there to look for items that need organizing.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and the wardrobe is already filled with clothing items. The chest of drawers is empty, and the bed is also empty. Since I have no items in my inventory, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available direction to move is south, which leads to the living room. I should go there to find more items to organize.

Next action: go south

Consideration: I am currently in the living room, and my goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve my score. I need to identify any items in the living room that are out of place and should be moved to another location. The inventory is currently empty, so I need to take an item first. The living room has a sofa, coffee table, armchair with a brown coat, and a bookcase. Since the brown coat is on the armchair, it might be out of place and should be put in the wardrobe in the bedroom. Therefore, I should take the brown coat first.
