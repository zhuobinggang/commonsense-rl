- The current environment is the backyard, which includes a BBQ with a wooden spoon, a clothesline, a patio chair with a wet white jumper, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot.

Consideration: The dirty cake slice is currently in my inventory. Previously, I attempted to put it in the trash can, but it was the wrong position. Since I am in the kitchen, I should consider other possible locations for the dirty cake slice. The oven, dining table, ladderback chair, counter, stove, and dining chair are potential supporters in the kitchen. The fridge and dishwasher are containers, but they are not suitable for a dirty cake slice. The counter might be a suitable place to put the dirty cake slice, as it is a common place for food items in a kitchen.

Next action: put dirty cake slice on counter

Consideration: The dirty cake slice is currently on the counter, but it seems to be in the wrong position. Since the trash can was also not the correct place, it might need to be placed in a different room. I should explore other rooms to find the right location for the dirty cake slice.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and my inventory is empty. The backyard has a BBQ, a clothesline with a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. Since the clean pot is on the workbench, it might be more appropriate to move it to the kitchen where it belongs. To do this, I need to take the clean pot from the workbench and then move to the kitchen.

Next action: 1. take clean pot

Consideration: I currently have a clean pot in my inventory. The clean pot should be placed in a location where clean kitchen items are typically stored. Since I am in the backyard, I should move to a location where kitchen items are stored, such as the kitchen. The kitchen is likely to be west of my current location, as I previously moved east to enter the backyard.

Next action: go west
