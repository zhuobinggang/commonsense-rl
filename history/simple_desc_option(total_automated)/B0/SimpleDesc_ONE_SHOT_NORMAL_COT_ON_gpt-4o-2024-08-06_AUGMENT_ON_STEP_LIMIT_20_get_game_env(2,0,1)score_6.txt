Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a wet azure skirt. The wet azure skirt should be placed in a location where it can dry, such as a clothesline or a clothes drier. Since I am in the kitchen, I need to find a way to reach a location suitable for drying clothes. The backyard might have a clothesline, as I previously placed a wet white jumper there. Therefore, I should move to the backyard to place the wet azure skirt on the clothesline.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and my inventory is empty. The backyard contains a BBQ, a clothesline with a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. Since the clean pot is on the workbench, it might be more appropriate to place it in the kitchen where it belongs. Therefore, I should take the clean pot from the workbench and move it to the kitchen.

Next action: 1. take clean pot

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard and carrying a clean pot. The clean pot should be placed in a location where clean kitchen items are typically stored. Since I have previously placed a wooden spoon in the cutlery drawer in the kitchen, it would be logical to place the clean pot in the kitchen as well. Therefore, I should move to the kitchen to find an appropriate place for the clean pot.

Consideration: I need to identify any items in the current environment that are not in their proper locations and can be moved to improve my score. The current environment is the kitchen, and the inventory is empty. The trash can contains a "dirty cake slice," which was previously placed there incorrectly. I should consider moving it to a more appropriate location. Since the trash can is not the right place, I should explore other rooms to find a suitable location for the dirty cake slice.

Next action: go east
