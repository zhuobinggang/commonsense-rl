Consideration: I am currently in the Laundry Room, and I have a pair of wet plaid socks in my inventory. The proper location for wet items is the clothes drier. The clothes drier already contains wet white panties and a wet blue jumper, so it is the appropriate place to put the wet plaid socks. By placing the wet plaid socks in the clothes drier, I will likely increase my score.
