Coats and shirts typically belong in a wardrobe or closet, but since I don't have access to those right now, I should focus on organizing the living room. The black coat and brown coat should be placed on a coat rack if available, or neatly on the armchair. The clean teal skirt and clean gray polo shirt should be placed on a flat surface like the coffee table or neatly folded on the armchair.
