Task: Simplify the environment description.
The environment description:
-= Kitchen =-You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. The room is well lit.You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains some milk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a clean pot. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. What a letdown! The cutlery drawer is empty! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a dishwasher. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The dishwasher contains a dirty pot. You can see an opened trash can nearby. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an oven. Huh, weird. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a dining chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.There is an open sliding patio door leading east.
Response (Response with the new environment description directly):


You are in a well-lit kitchen. There's a fridge with some milk inside, a cupboard with a clean pot, and a dishwasher containing a dirty pot. An empty cutlery drawer and an empty trash can are also present. The oven is empty, and the large dining table has nothing on it. A ladderback chair and a conventional stove are both empty as well. There is an open sliding patio door leading east.
