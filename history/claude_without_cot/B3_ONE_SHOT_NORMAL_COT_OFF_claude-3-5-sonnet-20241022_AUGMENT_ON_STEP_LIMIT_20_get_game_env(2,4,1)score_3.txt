The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have several clothing items:
- A pair of blue moccasins (in inventory)
- A pair of brown moccasins (on nightstand)
- A clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
- A clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
- Shoes might have a specific place

3. Since we have an open wardrobe and chest of drawers, and we're carrying blue moccasins, we should try storing them in one of these storage locations.

4. The wardrobe is typically used for hanging clothes, while drawers are more appropriate for shoes.

Therefore, I choose:

Next action: insert blue moccasins into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical action to try to improve our score by putting the shoes in an appropriate storage location.

Looking at the previous action where putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, and considering we need to put things in their proper locations, I should first take the blue moccasins back from the chest of drawers.

Next action: take blue moccasins from chest of drawers

Reasoning:
1. The game indicated that putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong ("Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room")
2. To fix this mistake, we first need to take the blue moccasins back
3. Once we have them in our inventory, we can then try to find their proper location, likely in another room as suggested by the game's hint

Looking at the example walkthrough and the current situation, I notice that shoes (like moccasins) should probably go in a shoe cabinet, which isn't in this room. Since there's a path south, I should explore that direction to find the proper location for the blue moccasins.

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. From previous attempt, putting blue moccasins in chest of drawers was wrong
2. The example walkthrough shows items need to be placed in specific locations to get points
3. Since there's no shoe storage in this room, and there's a path south, exploring the next room is logical
4. This will help us find the proper location for the blue moccasins, similar to how in the example walkthrough players moved between rooms to place items correctly

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying blue moccasins, which are shoes
2. I'm in a corridor where there's a shoe cabinet
3. The shoe cabinet is specifically designed for storing shoes
4. From the example walkthrough, I can see that proper placement of items increases the score
5. Logically, shoes should go in a shoe cabinet

Therefore, I should choose:
Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

This makes the most sense because:
- Shoes belong in a shoe cabinet
- It's a logical storage location
- The example shows that putting items in their proper places increases the score
- The shoe cabinet is currently empty and available

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
- clean white skirt on coat hanger
- clean white socks on floor
- blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clothes typically go on hangers/racks
- Shoes go in shoe cabinet
- The blue moccasins are already in the right place

3. Looking at the items:
- The clean white socks are on the floor, which isn't a proper storage place
- The white skirt is already on a coat hanger, which seems correct
- We should probably pick up the socks first to put them away properly

Therefore, I would choose:

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning: We should pick up the socks from the floor first since items on the floor generally need to be put away properly. Once we have them, we can explore to find their proper storage location.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations: shoe cabinet, hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, and coat hanger
3. Given that this is a corridor and these are clean white socks (clothing item), the most logical place would be the coat hanger where other clean clothes (white skirt) are stored
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that clothing items typically go on appropriate storage furniture (like hats on hat rack)

Therefore, I believe the most logical next action is:
put clean white socks on coat hanger

This makes sense because:
- The socks are clean (like the skirt already on the coat hanger)
- Coat hangers are meant for storing clean clothes
- There's already another clean clothing item (white skirt) on the coat hanger, suggesting it's the right place for clean clothes

Next action: put clean white socks on coat hanger

You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. On the coat hanger you can see a pair of clean white socks and a clean white skirt.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
Action you can take:
* close shoe cabinet
* examine blue moccasins
* examine clean white skirt
* examine clean white socks
* examine coat hanger
* examine hat rack
* examine key holder
* examine shoe cabinet
* examine umbrella stand
* go north
* look
* take blue moccasins from shoe cabinet
* take clean white skirt from coat hanger
* take clean white socks from coat hanger

Looking at the situation, I notice the clean white socks are on the coat hanger, which was previously determined to be the wrong position. Since we need to put things in their proper locations, we should:

Next action: take clean white socks from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. We know from the previous action history that clean white socks were wrongly placed on the coat hanger (Action 5)
2. Clean clothes like socks typically belong in a chest of drawers or similar storage
3. The other room (to the north) might have the proper storage for clean socks
4. First step is to take the socks so we can move them to the correct location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying clean white socks which need to be put somewhere proper
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes go in the laundry room
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack
3. Since these are clean socks, they should be stored properly in the laundry room
4. I'm currently in the corridor, and there's an exit to the north which likely leads to the laundry room
5. Therefore, I should first go to the laundry room before trying to store the socks

Next action: go north

This is the best next action because:
1. We need to get to the laundry room to properly store the clean socks
2. Going north is the available direction that will likely take us to the laundry room
3. We should move to the correct room before attempting to store items

You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like a wardrobe or chest of drawers
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that proper placement of items increases the score

5. Since these are clean clothes, they should be stored properly

I'll choose:
Next action: insert clean white socks into wardrobe

Reasoning: Clean clothes should be stored in a wardrobe, and since this is a clean pair of socks, putting them in the wardrobe seems like the most logical choice to improve the score.

Looking at the previous actions and their results, I notice that:
1. Clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
2. Shoes belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
3. The clean white socks were rejected from both the wardrobe and coat hanger

Since there are brown moccasins on the nightstand, and we know from experience that shoes belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor, I should:

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

This will allow me to then move to the corridor and place them in the shoe cabinet, which should increase the score based on the previous successful placement of blue moccasins.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have brown moccasins in my inventory, and from the previous actions I learned that:
   * Shoes (like blue moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
   * The shoe cabinet is in the corridor (south)

2. From the previous attempt with blue moccasins:
   * Putting shoes in the chest of drawers was wrong
   * Putting them in the shoe cabinet was right and scored a point

3. Therefore, I should:
   * Go to the corridor (south) to access the shoe cabinet
   * Put the brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet, similar to what worked with the blue moccasins

Next action: go south

This will allow me to then put the brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet in the next turn, which should increase the score.

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, shoes should go in the shoe cabinet. Since I'm holding brown moccasins and we saw earlier that putting blue moccasins in the shoe cabinet was correct (increased score), I should:

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
1. The shoe cabinet is the proper storage location for shoes (as proven by the blue moccasins scoring point earlier)
2. Brown moccasins are shoes, so they belong in the shoe cabinet
3. This action should increase the score like it did for the blue moccasins
4. Other locations like coat hanger, hat rack, etc. are meant for different types of items

Looking at the current situation and the example walkthrough, I notice that clean clothes like the white skirt should be stored properly. Since it's currently on a coat hanger in the corridor, and clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like a wardrobe or chest of drawers in the bedroom, I should:

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. The clean white skirt is currently on a coat hanger in the corridor
2. From previous attempts with clean white socks, we know clean clothes don't belong in the corridor
3. We should move it to the bedroom (north) where we can find proper storage furniture
4. First step is to take the item, then we can move to the bedroom and find the right storage location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm holding a clean white skirt
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes or drawers
3. The coat hanger seems like a reasonable place for clean clothes
4. We tried putting clean white socks in the wardrobe earlier and it was wrong
5. Since this is a clean piece of clothing, and we have a coat hanger available, that seems like the most logical place for it

Next action: put clean white skirt on coat hanger

Reasoning: Clean clothes are typically hung up, and a coat hanger is specifically designed for hanging clothes. Since this is a clean white skirt, putting it on the coat hanger is likely the correct action to improve our score.

Looking at the history, we've been trying to find the right place for the clean white skirt. We tried the coat hanger in the corridor but it was wrong. Since it's a clean clothing item, it likely belongs in storage furniture in the bedroom (similar to how clean socks should go in storage).

Therefore, we should:
1. Take the clean white skirt from the coat hanger
2. Go north to the bedroom
3. Try putting it in storage furniture there

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. Clean clothes typically belong in a bedroom storage like a wardrobe or chest of drawers

   - Shoe cabinet: for shoes
   - Hat rack: for hats
   - Coat hanger: for coats
   - Umbrella stand: for umbrellas
   - Key holder: for keys
4. I need to go to the bedroom to find proper storage for clothes

The wardrobe contains a pair of clean white socks. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers
3. From the example walkthrough, I see that clothes are being put in their proper places to increase score
4. Looking at the available actions, I can either put the skirt in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
5. Since it's a clothing item meant to be hung (like dresses), the wardrobe would be more appropriate than a chest of drawers

Next action: insert clean white skirt into wardrobe

This seems like the most logical choice because:
1. The wardrobe is designed for hanging clothes like skirts
2. The item is clean, so it should be stored properly
3. Wardrobes are typically used for storing clean clothes
4. This follows the pattern of putting items in their proper storage locations to increase score

What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
- clean azure skirt on dressing table
- clean plaid pullover on nightstand
- clean white skirt and clean white socks in wardrobe

2. From previous actions, we know:
- Clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe (as shown by the clean white skirt being correctly placed there)
- The clean white socks are currently in the wardrobe but that was marked as wrong position

3. Therefore:
- The clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover should probably go in the wardrobe
- The clean white socks need to be moved somewhere else

4. Since the clean white socks are in the wrong place, and we need to move things one at a time, we should start by:

Next action: take clean white socks from wardrobe

This will allow us to later find the correct location for the socks and make room in the wardrobe for other clean clothes.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. From the example walkthrough, I see that clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
3. Looking at my previous actions, I tried putting the clean white socks in the wardrobe before but took them back out
4. However, since clean white skirt went into the wardrobe successfully and increased the score, the wardrobe seems to be the right place for clean clothes
5. Therefore, I should try putting the clean white socks in the wardrobe again

Next action: insert clean white socks into wardrobe

This makes sense because:
- The socks are clean (like the skirt that went into the wardrobe)
- The wardrobe is typically used for storing clothes
- We've seen success with putting other clean items in the wardrobe

Looking at the items and previous actions, I notice that:
1. Clean clothes (skirts, pullovers) typically belong in the wardrobe
2. The clean azure skirt is on the dressing table
3. We've already successfully put a clean white skirt in the wardrobe

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

This is a good next step because:
1. The clean azure skirt is likely meant to go in the wardrobe (since it's a clean clothing item)
2. It's currently not in its proper location (dressing table)
3. We need to pick it up first before we can put it in its proper place
4. This follows the pattern of the successful score increase we got from putting the clean white skirt in the wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying a clean azure skirt
2. From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I've learned:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe already has clean white socks and clean white skirt, and putting the clean white skirt there was correct (got a point)

3. Since the azure skirt is clean, it should also go in the wardrobe like other clean clothes.

Therefore, I choose:

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe

This action should be correct because:
- The item is clean clothing
- Other clean clothing items (like the clean white skirt) got points for being put in the wardrobe
- The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes
