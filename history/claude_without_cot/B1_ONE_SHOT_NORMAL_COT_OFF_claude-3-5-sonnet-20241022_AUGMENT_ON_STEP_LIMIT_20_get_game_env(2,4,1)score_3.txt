The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have several clothing items:
- A pair of blue moccasins (in inventory)
- A pair of brown moccasins (on nightstand)
- A clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
- A clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
- Shoes might have a specific place

3. Since we have an open wardrobe and chest of drawers, and we're carrying blue moccasins, we should try storing them in one of these storage locations.

4. The wardrobe is typically used for hanging clothes, while drawers are more appropriate for shoes.

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: insert blue moccasins into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical action to try to improve our score by putting the shoes in an appropriate storage location.

Looking at the previous action where putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, and considering we need to put things in their proper locations, I should first take the blue moccasins back from the chest of drawers.

Next action: take blue moccasins from chest of drawers

Reasoning:
1. The game indicated that putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong ("Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room")
2. To fix this mistake, we first need to take the blue moccasins back
3. Once we have them in our inventory, we can then try to find their proper location, likely in another room as suggested by the game's hint

Looking at the example walkthrough and the current situation, I notice that shoes (like moccasins) should probably go in a shoe cabinet, which isn't in this room. Since there's a path south, I should explore that direction to find the proper location for the blue moccasins.

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. From previous attempt, we know the chest of drawers is wrong for the blue moccasins
2. The example walkthrough shows items need to be placed in specific locations to get points
3. Since there's no shoe storage in this room, and there's a path south, exploring the next room is the logical next step
4. This will help us find the proper location for the blue moccasins and improve our score

Looking at the available actions and considering that we have blue moccasins in our inventory, the most logical action would be to:

Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
1. Moccasins are footwear, and a shoe cabinet is specifically designed to store shoes
2. From the example walkthrough, we can see that putting items in their proper thematic locations increases the score
3. The shoe cabinet is currently empty and is the most appropriate location for shoes
4. Other options like hat rack, key holder, or umbrella stand are meant for different types of items (hats, keys, and umbrellas respectively)

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
- clean white skirt on coat hanger
- clean white socks on floor
- blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clothes typically go on hangers/racks
- Shoes go in shoe cabinet
- The blue moccasins are already in the right place

3. Looking at the items:
- The clean white socks are on the floor, which isn't a proper storage place
- The white skirt is already on a coat hanger, which seems correct
- We should probably pick up the socks first to put them away properly

Therefore, I think we should:

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning: We should pick up the socks from the floor first since items on the floor generally need to be put away properly. Once we have them, we can explore to find the proper storage location for them (likely in a drawer or similar storage).

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations: shoe cabinet, hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, and coat hanger
3. Given that this is a corridor and these are clean white socks (clothing item), the most logical place would be the coat hanger where other clean clothes (white skirt) are stored
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that clothing items typically go on appropriate storage furniture (like hats on hat rack)

Therefore, I believe the most logical next action is:

Next action: put clean white socks on coat hanger

This makes sense because:
- The socks are clean (not dirty or wet)
- The coat hanger already has other clean clothing (white skirt)
- It's a proper storage location for clothing items
- Following the pattern from the example where items were placed in appropriate locations to gain points

Looking at the situation, I notice the clean white socks are on the coat hanger, which was previously determined to be the wrong position. Since we need to put things in their proper locations, we should:

Next action: take clean white socks from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. We know from the previous action history that clean white socks were wrongly placed on the coat hanger (Action 5)
2. Clean clothes like socks typically belong in storage furniture like a chest of drawers or closet
3. The first step to putting it in the right place is to take it from its wrong location
4. There might be proper storage furniture in the other room (north) where we can place these socks correctly

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying clean white socks which need to be put somewhere proper
2. Looking at the environment, this is a corridor with storage furniture
3. Clean clothes typically belong in drawers or closets, not in corridor furniture
4. There's a room to the north that might be more appropriate
5. Since I need to find the proper location for the clean white socks, and this corridor doesn't seem like the right place, I should explore the other room

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: go north

This will let me explore the other room to find a more appropriate place for the clean white socks, since corridor furniture (shoe cabinet, hat rack, coat hanger) doesn't seem like the proper place for storing clean socks.

Looking at the previous actions and their results, I notice that:
1. Clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
2. Shoes belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
3. The clean white socks were rejected from both the wardrobe and coat hanger

Since there are brown moccasins on the nightstand, and we know from experience that shoes belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor, I should:

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

This will allow me to then move to the corridor and place them in the shoe cabinet, similar to what worked with the blue moccasins earlier.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have brown moccasins in my inventory
2. Earlier in the game, blue moccasins were correctly placed in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
3. Since brown moccasins are similar to blue moccasins, they likely belong in the same place
4. When I tried putting items in the bedroom furniture before (like the clean white socks in the wardrobe), it was wrong
5. The game suggested "maybe the other room" when items were in wrong positions
6. Therefore, I should go to the corridor to put the brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, shoes should go in the shoe cabinet. Since I'm holding brown moccasins and we saw earlier that putting blue moccasins in the shoe cabinet was correct (increased score), I should:

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

This makes sense because:
1. It's similar to the successful action with the blue moccasins earlier
2. The shoe cabinet is the logical place for any type of shoes
3. The other options like putting them on the coat hanger, hat rack, or umbrella stand wouldn't make logical sense for shoes

Looking at the current situation and the example walkthrough, I notice that clean clothes like the white skirt should be stored in the wardrobe or chest of drawers in the bedroom. Since the clean white skirt is currently on the coat hanger in the corridor, we should:

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. Clean clothes belong in storage furniture in the bedroom (like wardrobe or chest of drawers)
2. The white skirt is clean and currently in the wrong location (coat hanger in corridor)
3. We need to first take it before we can move it to its proper location
4. This follows the pattern from the example where items need to be moved to their correct locations to improve the score

After taking it, we can then move north to the bedroom and put it in the appropriate storage furniture.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm holding a clean white skirt
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes or drawers
3. The coat hanger seems like a reasonable place for clean clothes
4. We tried putting clean white socks in the wardrobe earlier and it was wrong
5. Looking at the available actions, putting the clean white skirt on the coat hanger seems most logical for clean clothing

Next action: put clean white skirt on coat hanger

This makes sense because:
- It's a clean piece of clothing
- Coat hangers are designed for hanging clothes
- It's similar to how we'd organize things in real life
- We haven't tried this specific combination yet

Looking at the history, we've been trying to find the right place for the clean white skirt. We tried the coat hanger in the corridor but it was wrong. Since it's a clean clothing item, it likely belongs in a storage furniture in the bedroom (like the wardrobe or chest of drawers).

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

This will allow us to then go north to the bedroom and try putting it in the proper storage furniture there.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes, dressers, or chest of drawers
3. The current room (corridor) has:
   - shoe cabinet (for shoes)
   - hat rack (for hats)
   - umbrella stand (for umbrellas)
   - coat hanger (for coats)
   - key holder (for keys)
4. None of these are appropriate for storing a clean skirt
5. There's an exit to the north (bedroom), which likely has more appropriate furniture for clothes

Therefore, I should:

Next action: go north

Reasoning: I need to go to the bedroom because it's more likely to have proper storage furniture for clean clothes like a wardrobe or chest of drawers. The corridor's furniture isn't suitable for storing a clean skirt.

You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors?

Let me think about this step by step:

1. From the example walkthrough, I see that clean clothes typically go into the wardrobe or chest of drawers in the bedroom.

2. Looking at the current state:
- There's a clean azure skirt on the dressing table
- There's a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand
- There's a clean white skirt in the chest of drawers (which was previously determined to be wrong)
- There's clean white socks in the wardrobe (which was previously determined to be wrong)

3. Since we know the clean white skirt and socks are in wrong positions, and we have other clean items not properly stored yet, let's start with moving one of those.

4. The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table, and as a clean clothing item, it should probably go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers.

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean azure skirt in my inventory
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that clean clothes typically go into the chest of drawers or wardrobe
3. Looking at previous actions in the history, I tried putting clean clothes in various places, and the chest of drawers was wrong for the clean white skirt
4. This suggests the wardrobe might be the correct place for clean clothes
5. Since I have a clean azure skirt, I should try putting it in the wardrobe

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe

This seems like the most logical choice because:
- It's a clean piece of clothing
- The wardrobe is a typical storage place for clean clothes
- We haven't tried the wardrobe for clean clothes yet
- Previous attempts with the chest of drawers were wrong

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough and action history, I notice:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is the right place for clean skirts (as shown by the clean azure skirt being correctly placed there)

2. Currently in the environment:
   - There's a clean white skirt in the chest of drawers
   - From previous actions, we know this was marked as "Wrong position"

3. Therefore, we should:
   - Take the clean white skirt from the chest of drawers
   - Later move it to the wardrobe (which we know is the correct location for clean clothes)

Next action: take clean white skirt from chest of drawers

This is the best next action because:
1. We know the chest of drawers is the wrong location for the clean white skirt
2. We need to move it to improve our score
3. We have to take it before we can put it in its correct location (the wardrobe)

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and their results, I notice:
1. Clean clothes (like the clean azure skirt) belong in the wardrobe
2. The clean white skirt I'm holding is also a clean clothing item
3. When I tried putting the clean white skirt in the chest of drawers earlier, it was wrong
4. When I put the clean azure skirt in the wardrobe, it was correct and increased the score

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert clean white skirt into wardrobe

This should be the correct location since:
- It's a clean clothing item like the azure skirt that was correctly placed there
- We've already tried other locations that were wrong
- The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage place for clean clothes
