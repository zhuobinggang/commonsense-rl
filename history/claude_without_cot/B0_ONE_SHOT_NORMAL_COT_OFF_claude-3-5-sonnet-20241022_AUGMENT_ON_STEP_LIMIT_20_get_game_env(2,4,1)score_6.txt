The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have several clothing items:
- A pair of blue moccasins (in inventory)
- A pair of brown moccasins (on nightstand)
- A clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
- A clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
- Shoes might have a specific place

3. Since we have an open wardrobe and chest of drawers, and we're carrying blue moccasins, we should try storing them in one of these storage locations.

4. The wardrobe is typically used for hanging clothes, while drawers are more appropriate for shoes.

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: insert blue moccasins into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical action to try to improve our score by putting the shoes in an appropriate storage location.

Looking at the previous action where putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, and considering we need to put things in their proper locations, I should first take the blue moccasins back from the chest of drawers.

Next action: take blue moccasins from chest of drawers

Reasoning:
1. The game indicated that putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong ("Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room")
2. To fix this mistake, we first need to take the blue moccasins back
3. Once we have them in our inventory, we can then try to find their proper location, likely in another room as suggested by the game's hint

Looking at the example walkthrough and the current situation, I notice that shoes (like moccasins) should probably go in a shoe cabinet, which isn't in this room. Since there's a path south, I should explore that direction to find the proper location for the blue moccasins.

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. From previous attempt, putting blue moccasins in chest of drawers was wrong
2. The example walkthrough shows items need to be placed in specific locations to get points
3. Since there's no shoe storage in this room, and there's a path south, exploring the next room is logical
4. This will help us find the proper location for the blue moccasins, similar to how in the example walkthrough players moved between rooms to place items correctly

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I should put the blue moccasins in the shoe cabinet since that's the most logical place for shoes.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
1. I'm carrying blue moccasins which are shoes
2. There's an empty shoe cabinet in the corridor
3. Shoes naturally belong in a shoe cabinet
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that organizing items in their logical locations increases the score
5. The previous attempt to put the moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, suggesting they belong somewhere else, and the shoe cabinet is the most appropriate location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
- clean white skirt on coat hanger
- clean white socks on floor
- blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clothes typically go on hangers/racks
- Shoes go in shoe cabinet
- The blue moccasins are already in the right place

3. Looking at the items:
- The clean white socks are on the floor, which isn't a proper storage place
- The white skirt is already on a coat hanger, which seems correct
- We should probably pick up the socks first to put them away properly

Therefore, I think we should:

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning: We should pick up the socks from the floor first since items on the floor generally need to be put away properly. Once we have them, we can explore to find the proper storage location for them (likely in a drawer or similar storage).

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations: shoe cabinet, hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, and coat hanger
3. Given that this is a corridor and these are clean white socks (clothing item), the most logical place would be the coat hanger where other clean clothes (white skirt) are stored
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that clothing items typically go on appropriate storage furniture (like hats on hat rack)

Therefore, I believe the most logical next action is:
put clean white socks on coat hanger

This makes sense because:
- The socks are clean (not dirty for laundry)
- The coat hanger already has other clean clothing (white skirt)
- It's a proper storage location for clothing items

Next action: put clean white socks on coat hanger

You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. On the coat hanger you can see a pair of clean white socks and a clean white skirt.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
Action you can take:
* close shoe cabinet
* examine blue moccasins
* examine clean white skirt
* examine clean white socks
* examine coat hanger
* examine hat rack
* examine key holder
* examine shoe cabinet
* examine umbrella stand
* go north
* look
* take blue moccasins from shoe cabinet
* take clean white skirt from coat hanger
* take clean white socks from coat hanger

Looking at the situation, I notice the clean white socks are on the coat hanger, which was previously determined to be the wrong position. Since we need to put things in their proper locations, we should:

Next action: take clean white socks from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. We know from the previous action history that clean white socks were wrongly placed on the coat hanger (Action 5)
2. Clean clothes like socks typically belong in a chest of drawers or similar storage
3. The other room (to the north) might have the proper storage for clean socks
4. First step is to take the socks so we can move them to the correct location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying clean white socks which need to be put somewhere proper
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes go in the laundry room
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack
3. Since these are clean socks, they should be stored properly in the laundry room
4. I'm currently in the corridor, and there's an exit to the north which likely leads to the laundry room
5. Therefore, I should first go to the laundry room before trying to store the socks

Next action: go north

This is the best next action because:
1. We need to get to the laundry room to properly store the clean socks
2. Going north is the available direction that will likely take us to the laundry room
3. We should move to the correct room before attempting to store items

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm holding clean white socks that need to be stored properly
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like a wardrobe or chest of drawers
3. From the example walkthrough, I see that clothing items are being put in their proper places to increase score
4. Between wardrobe and chest of drawers, the chest of drawers is more commonly used for storing socks

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert clean white socks into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical choice since socks are typically stored in drawers rather than hung in a wardrobe or placed elsewhere in the bedroom.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, I see several items:
- brown moccasins on nightstand
- clean azure skirt on dressing table
- clean plaid pullover on nightstand
- clean white socks in chest of drawers

2. From the previous example walkthrough, I learned that:
- Shoes (like moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
- Clean clothes typically go in the chest of drawers

3. The clean white socks are already in the correct place (chest of drawers), as proven by the previous action history.

4. Therefore, I should focus on moving the other items to their proper locations.

5. Since shoes belong in the shoe cabinet (like the blue moccasins in the action history), I should first take the brown moccasins to move them to the corridor's shoe cabinet.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have brown moccasins in my inventory
2. Earlier in the game, blue moccasins were correctly placed in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
3. This suggests that moccasins belong in the shoe cabinet, not in the bedroom
4. Therefore, I should go to the corridor to put the brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet
5. Looking at the available actions, "go south" will take me to the corridor

Next action: go south

This is the best action because:
- We know from previous experience that moccasins belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
- We need to go south to reach the corridor

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the example walkthrough, I notice that:
1. Shoes (like blue moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet
2. The brown moccasins I'm carrying are also shoes
3. The blue moccasins are already correctly placed in the shoe cabinet (got a point for that)

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

This is the most logical action because:
1. It follows the same pattern as the blue moccasins which got a point when placed in the shoe cabinet
2. The shoe cabinet is the proper storage location for footwear
3. This action will likely increase the score as it puts the item in its proper location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have a clean white skirt on a coat hanger.
2. From the example walkthrough, we know that clothing items like socks belong in the chest of drawers in the bedroom.
3. The bedroom is to the north of the current location.
4. The clean white skirt, being a clothing item, likely belongs in the chest of drawers like the socks did.
5. To move the skirt, we first need to take it.

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

This will allow us to then move north to the bedroom and try to put the skirt in the chest of drawers, similar to what worked with the clean white socks earlier.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm holding a clean white skirt
2. From the example walkthrough, I learned that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the chest of drawers
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack

3. Since this is a clean white skirt, it should probably go in the chest of drawers, which is in the bedroom

4. Looking at the available actions and knowing that the bedroom is to the north

Therefore, I should:

Next action: go north

This will take me to the bedroom where I can put the clean white skirt in the chest of drawers, which is likely the proper location for clean clothes.

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes like skirts should go into the wardrobe or chest of drawers. Since I'm holding a clean white skirt, I should put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: insert clean white skirt into wardrobe

Reasoning:
1. The clean white skirt is a clean clothing item
2. Clean clothes belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers
3. The wardrobe is currently empty
4. In previous successful actions, we put clean socks in the chest of drawers

2. The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Reasoning:
- The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table, which is not its proper storage location
- Clean clothes should be stored in proper storage furniture (wardrobe or chest of drawers)
- Taking the skirt is the first step to being able to store it properly
- This follows the pattern from previous successful actions where we properly stored other clean clothes (like the clean white skirt in the wardrobe)

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the example walkthrough, clean clothes like skirts typically belong in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a clean azure skirt, I should put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe

Let me explain why:
1. Clean clothes (especially dresses and skirts) have been consistently stored in the wardrobe, as shown by the clean white skirt being correctly placed there earlier
2. The wardrobe is a proper storage location for clean clothing items
3. The azure skirt is clean, so it belongs with other clean clothes
4. This action is likely to increase the score based on similar patterns in previous actions

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean azure skirt and a clean white skirt. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a pair of clean white socks. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment and available items, I see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand.
2. From the example walkthrough, I learned that clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers.
3. Since there's already clean skirts in the wardrobe, it seems the wardrobe is for clean clothes.
4. Therefore, the clean plaid pullover should probably be moved from the nightstand to the wardrobe.

Next action: take clean plaid pullover from nightstand

This action will let me pick up the clean plaid pullover, and then in the next turn I can put it in the wardrobe where it likely belongs.

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the current state, I notice:
1. Clean clothes (skirts, socks) belong in bedroom storage furniture (wardrobe, chest of drawers)
2. The clean plaid pullover is in my inventory
3. Since it's a clean clothing item, it likely belongs in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
4. Previous actions show that larger clothing items (skirts) went into the wardrobe

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert clean plaid pullover into wardrobe

This follows the pattern of putting clean clothing items in proper bedroom storage, with larger garments specifically going into the wardrobe.
