Looking at the available actions and considering that I have a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory, the most logical action would be to store it in the wardrobe since that's where clean clothes typically belong.

Next action: insert clean plaid polo shirt into wardrobe

This is likely to be the correct action because:
1. The wardrobe is a proper storage location for clean clothes
2. The item is a clean piece of clothing
3. Based on the pattern in the example walkthrough where items were placed in their proper locations (like putting caps on hat racks), storing clean clothes in a wardrobe should increase the score

Since the clean plaid polo shirt is already in the wardrobe and got us a point (from Action 0), and there are no other items to organize in this room, we should explore other rooms to find more items to organize.

Next action: go east

Reasoning:
1. The clean plaid polo shirt is already properly placed in the wardrobe (we got a point for this)
2. There are no other items to organize in this room
3. From the example walkthrough, we know there are other rooms with items that need to be organized
4. Going east will let us explore new areas and find more items to organize
5. The room description mentions "You need an exit without a door? You should try going east."

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice there are several clothing items that are clean. From the previous example, I learned that clean clothes should go in the wardrobe, which is likely in another room.

Since we already successfully put a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe earlier, we should collect the other clean clothes. Let's start with:

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from sofa

Reasoning:
1. The jumper is marked as "clean", so it likely belongs in the wardrobe like the previous clean polo shirt
2. We should collect all clean clothes to move them to the wardrobe
3. Starting with the jumper is a good first step before collecting the other clean items (white polo shirt)
4. This follows the pattern from the example where we systematically collect and move items to their proper locations

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a clean checkered jumper, I should go back to where the wardrobe is.

Next action: go west

Reasoning: In the previous action history, we successfully put a clean plaid polo shirt into the wardrobe and got a point. Since I'm now holding another clean piece of clothing (the clean checkered jumper), I should return to the room with the wardrobe to store it properly. Going west will take me back to that room where I can then put the jumper in the wardrobe in the next turn.

Looking at the example walkthrough and the current situation, I notice that clean clothes belong in the wardrobe, as shown by the first action that put the clean plaid polo shirt there and got a point.

Since I'm holding a clean checkered jumper, and clean clothes should go in the wardrobe, I should:

Next action: insert clean checkered jumper into wardrobe

This should be the correct action because:
1. The item is clean (like the plaid polo shirt that got a point for being put in the wardrobe)
2. The wardrobe is the proper storage location for clean clothes
3. This action should increase the score by one point, similar to the example

Looking at the current state and available actions, I notice that both items in the wardrobe (clean checkered jumper and clean plaid polo shirt) are already in their correct locations since putting them there increased the score in previous actions. There's nothing else that needs to be moved or organized in this room.

Since there's nothing more to organize here, and we might find more items to sort in other rooms, the logical next action would be:

Next action: go east

This will take us to another room where we might find more items that need to be put in their proper locations.

Based on the example walkthrough and the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice that clean clothes belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom. Since there's a clean white polo shirt on the floor, we should take it and then put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

Reasoning:
1. We can see from previous actions that clean clothes should go in the wardrobe (like the clean plaid polo shirt and clean checkered jumper)
2. The clean white polo shirt is currently on the floor, which is not its proper location
3. We need to first take the item before we can move it to its proper location
4. After taking it, we can go west to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe in the next action

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes should be stored in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a clean white polo shirt, I should go west to the bedroom where the wardrobe is located and put it there.

Reasoning:
1. I'm currently holding a clean white polo shirt
2. Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe (as shown by previous successful actions with the clean plaid polo shirt and clean checkered jumper)
3. The wardrobe is in the bedroom which is to the west

Looking at the current state, all the clean clothes (plaid polo shirt, checkered jumper, white polo shirt) are already properly placed in the wardrobe, and we've gotten points for each of them. There doesn't seem to be any other items that need to be moved or organized.

Since there's nothing left to organize in this room to improve the score, and we might find more items to organize in other locations, the best action would be:

Next action: go east

This will take us to the livingroom where we might find more items that need to be put in their proper locations.

Looking at the previous actions and the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice that clean clothes should go in the wardrobe in the bedroom. I see there's a brown suit and a gray coat in the livingroom that could potentially be stored properly.

Since we're currently in the livingroom and there's a brown suit on the end table, let's start with that.

Next action: take brown suit from end table

Reasoning:
1. The brown suit appears to be a clean clothing item
2. Based on previous successful actions, clean clothes belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom
3. To move the suit to the wardrobe, we first need to take it
4. After taking it, we can go west to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe in the next action

Looking at the pattern from both the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe, which is in the bedroom. Since I'm carrying a brown suit and I'm in the livingroom, I should:

Next action: go west

Reasoning: Going west will take me to the bedroom where the wardrobe is located. Once there, I can put the brown suit in the wardrobe, which is likely to increase my score since that's the proper storage location for clean clothes. This follows the same pattern we saw with the clean plaid polo shirt, clean checkered jumper, and clean white polo shirt that were all successfully stored in the wardrobe for points.

Looking at the pattern from both the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes should go in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a brown suit, and the wardrobe is where other clean clothes have been successfully stored (getting points for each), I should:

Next action: insert brown suit into wardrobe

This action follows the pattern of putting clean clothing items into the wardrobe, which has consistently earned points in previous actions. The wardrobe already contains other clean clothes like the polo shirts and jumper, indicating it's the proper storage location for clean formal wear as well.

Looking at the current state and available actions, I notice that all the clean clothes are already properly stored in the wardrobe and we've already received points for those placements. There doesn't seem to be any new items in the environment that need to be moved to their proper locations.

Since there's nothing left to organize in this room, and we might find more items to organize in other locations, the most logical next action would be:

Next action: go east

This will take us to the livingroom where we might find more items that need to be properly placed to improve our score.

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice there's a gray coat on the armchair. Based on previous examples where clothing items were important, and the fact that coats typically belong in wardrobes, I should:

Next action: take gray coat from armchair

This is a good choice because:
1. It's a clothing item, which should probably go in the wardrobe like the other clothing items we've dealt with
2. The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west of here), where we've already successfully stored other clothing items
3. Moving clothing to proper storage locations has consistently increased the score in previous actions

After taking the coat, we can then move west to the bedroom and try to put it in the wardrobe.

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a brown suit, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Looking at the action history and current environment, I notice that we've already successfully placed several clean clothes in the wardrobe, which was the right position for them. The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes.

Since we've completed putting all clean clothes and suits in the wardrobe, and there are no other items in our inventory that need to be placed somewhere, there's not much left to do to improve our score in this room.

The most logical next step would be to:

Next action: go east

Reasoning:
1. All items in the wardrobe are already in their correct place (we got points for putting them there)
2. There are no items in our inventory that need to be placed
3. We should explore other rooms to find more items that need to be properly placed
4. Going east will take us to the livingroom where we might find more items to organize

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice there's a dictionary on the coffee table. Since books typically belong in a bookcase, I should:

Next action: take dictionary from coffee table

This will allow me to then move it to the bookcase, which would likely improve the score since it's a more appropriate location for a book.

Next action: <fill in>


Looking at the available actions and considering that I have a dictionary in my inventory, the most logical place for a dictionary would be in a bookcase. This follows the common sense rule that books belong in bookcases, and since there's an opened bookcase in the room, that would be the proper location.

Next action: insert dictionary into bookcase

This action should improve the score since it's putting the item in its proper location, similar to how putting clothes in the wardrobe in previous actions increased the score.
