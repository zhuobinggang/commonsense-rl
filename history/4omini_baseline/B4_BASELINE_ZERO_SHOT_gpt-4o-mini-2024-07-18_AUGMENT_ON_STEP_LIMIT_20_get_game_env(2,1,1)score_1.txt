Action 17: take clean checkered jumper from sofa -> You take the clean checkered jumper from the sofa. 
Inventory: You are carrying:  a clean checkered jumper
Environment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean white polo shirt on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

{'consideration': 'The clean checkered jumper should be placed in a proper location to improve my score. The bookcase is empty, but I have already tried putting items in there before. The armchair and end table are also options, but I need to find a suitable place. The sofa is already occupied with the clean white polo shirt, so I should avoid that. I will examine the armchair to see if it is a good place for the jumper.', 'action': 'examine armchair'}

The bookcase is empty, but I have already tried putting clothes in there before and it was the wrong position.
