Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. Currently, the only item in the room is the clean plaid polo shirt, which is already in the wardrobe.

The next logical step is to explore the room further by going east, as it might lead to another area with items that need organizing.

Consideration: I have already placed the clean plaid polo shirt and the clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe, which increased my score. The wardrobe is currently closed, and there are no other items in the room that I can interact with or move. To improve my score further, I need to find more items that can be placed in their proper locations. Since the bedroom seems to be fully explored and there are no items left to organize, I should explore the living room to find more items.

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa.
