Consideration: The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve the score. The wet blue jumper is currently in my inventory, and it is wet, which suggests it should be dried. The logical step would be to insert it into the clothes drier. Additionally, there are other wet and dirty clothes in the room that need to be sorted and placed appropriately. The washing machine is empty, which is unusual for a laundry room, so it might be a good idea to fill it with dirty clothes. However, since the wet blue jumper is already in my inventory, I should focus on it first.
