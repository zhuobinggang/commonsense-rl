Current environment: -= Kitchen =-You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. The room is well lit.You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains some milk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. What a letdown! The cutlery drawer is empty! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a dishwasher. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The dishwasher contains a dirty pot. You can see an opened trash can nearby. The trash can contains a dirty cake slice. You can see an oven. Huh, weird. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a dining chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.There is an open sliding patio door leading east.
