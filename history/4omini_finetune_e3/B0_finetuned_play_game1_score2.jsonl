A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You swear loudly.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.\nCurrent environment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a brown suit and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.\nAvailable actions:\n* close chest of drawers\n* close wardrobe\n* drop clean checkered jumper\n* drop clean white polo shirt\n* drop dictionary\n* drop gray coat\n* examine bed\n* examine brown suit\n* examine chest of drawers\n* examine clean plaid polo shirt\n* examine dark carpet\n* examine desk\n* examine desk chair\n* examine dressing table\n* examine nightstand\n* examine wardrobe\n* go east\n* insert clean checkered jumper into chest of drawers\n* insert clean checkered jumper into wardrobe\n* insert clean white polo shirt into chest of drawers\n* insert clean white polo shirt into wardrobe\n* insert dictionary into chest of drawers\n* insert dictionary into wardrobe\n* insert gray coat into chest of drawers\n* insert gray coat into wardrobe\n* look\n* put clean checkered jumper on bed\n* put clean checkered jumper on dark carpet\n* put clean checkered jumper on desk\n* put clean checkered jumper on desk chair\n* put clean checkered jumper on dressing table\n* put clean checkered jumper on nightstand\n* put clean white polo shirt on bed\n* put clean white polo shirt on dark carpet\n* put clean white polo shirt on desk\n* put clean white polo shirt on desk chair\n* put clean white polo shirt on dressing table\n* put clean white polo shirt on nightstand\n* put dictionary on bed\n* put dictionary on dark carpet\n* put dictionary on desk\n* put dictionary on desk chair\n* put dictionary on dressing table\n* put dictionary on nightstand\n* put gray coat on bed\n* put gray coat on dark carpet\n* put gray coat on desk\n* put gray coat on desk chair\n* put gray coat on dressing table\n* put gray coat on nightstand\n* take brown suit from wardrobe\n* take clean plaid polo shirt from wardrobe\nNext action:"}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'go east'}]}
