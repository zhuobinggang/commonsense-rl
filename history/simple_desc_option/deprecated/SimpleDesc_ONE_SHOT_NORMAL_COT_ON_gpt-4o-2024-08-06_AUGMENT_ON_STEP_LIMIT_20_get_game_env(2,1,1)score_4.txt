Consideration: I need to find the proper location for the clean white polo shirt that I am currently carrying. Since I am in the living room, I should consider if there is a suitable place here to put the shirt. The living room does not seem to have a wardrobe or any obvious place for clothing. Therefore, I should explore other rooms to find a more appropriate location for the shirt. The bedroom might have a wardrobe or closet where clothing is typically stored.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their correct locations. Currently, I am in the living room, and I can see a checkered jumper on the sofa, a gray coat on the armchair, and a brown suit on the end table. These items likely belong in a wardrobe or closet, which is typically found in a bedroom. Therefore, I should first take one of these items and then move to the bedroom to place it in the wardrobe.
