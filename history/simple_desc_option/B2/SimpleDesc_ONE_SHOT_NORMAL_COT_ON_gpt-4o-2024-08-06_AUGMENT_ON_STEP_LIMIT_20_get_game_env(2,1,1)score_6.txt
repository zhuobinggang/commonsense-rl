Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe already contains several clean clothing items, so I should look for any items in the bedroom that are out of place and need to be organized. Since the chest of drawers is empty, I should check if there are any items that belong there. If there are no items in the bedroom that need organizing, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be put in their proper locations.

Next action: go east

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to identify items in the living room that are not in their proper locations and move them to their appropriate places. Currently, the only item on a supporter is the dictionary on the coffee table, which seems appropriate. The wastepaper basket might contain something that needs to be disposed of or moved. I should check the wastepaper basket for any items that might need to be relocated.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and carrying a dictionary. I need to find the appropriate place to put the dictionary to increase my score. In a living room, a dictionary would typically be placed on a bookcase or a coffee table. Since I picked it up from the coffee table, it might be more appropriate to place it on the bookcase to improve my score.
