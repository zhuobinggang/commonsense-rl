Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a wet azure skirt. The wet azure skirt should be placed in a location where it can dry, such as a clothesline or a clothes drier. Since I am in the kitchen, I need to find a way to a location where I can properly place the wet azure skirt. The backyard might have a clothesline, as I previously placed a wet white jumper there. Therefore, I should move to the backyard to find the clothesline.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and my inventory is empty. The backyard contains a BBQ, a clothesline with a wet azure skirt and a wet white jumper, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. Since the clean pot is on the workbench, it might be more appropriate to place it in the kitchen, possibly in a cupboard or on a shelf. To do this, I need to take the clean pot and move to the kitchen.
