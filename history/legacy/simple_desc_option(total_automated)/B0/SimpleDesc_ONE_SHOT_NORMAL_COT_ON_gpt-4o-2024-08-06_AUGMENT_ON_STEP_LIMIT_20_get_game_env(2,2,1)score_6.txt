Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. In the living room, I see a black coat on the sofa, a brown coat and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Coats are typically hung on a coat rack, and clean clothes like the teal skirt and gray polo shirt should be placed in a wardrobe. However, I need to take these items first before I can put them in their proper locations. Since I am currently in the living room, I should start by taking one of the items.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe in the bedroom already contains several items of clothing, which are in their proper location. The chest of drawers is empty, and the bed is also empty. Since I have no items in my inventory, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available direction to move is south, which leads to the living room. I should go there to look for items that need to be organized.

Next action: go south
