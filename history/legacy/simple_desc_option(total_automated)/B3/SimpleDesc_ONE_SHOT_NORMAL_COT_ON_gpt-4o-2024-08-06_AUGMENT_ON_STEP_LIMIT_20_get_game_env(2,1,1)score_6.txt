Consideration: I am currently in the living room and carrying a gray coat. The living room has several pieces of furniture, but none of them seem appropriate for placing a coat. The coat would likely belong in a wardrobe, which is typically found in a bedroom. I should head back to the bedroom to put the gray coat in the wardrobe, as this will likely increase my score.
