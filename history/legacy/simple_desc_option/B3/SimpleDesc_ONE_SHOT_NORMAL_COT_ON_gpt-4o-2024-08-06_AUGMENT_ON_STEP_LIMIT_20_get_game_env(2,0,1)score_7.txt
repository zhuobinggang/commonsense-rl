Consideration: I need to identify items in the current environment that are not in their proper locations and determine where they should be placed. The current environment is the kitchen, and I have some milk in my inventory. The dirty cake slice on the counter should likely be placed in the trash can, and the wet azure skirt on the dining chair should be moved to a clothesline or clothes drier. However, since I am currently in the kitchen, I should focus on actions that can be completed here. The milk in my inventory should be placed in the fridge.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a clean pot. The clean pot should be placed in a location where clean kitchenware is typically stored. The cutlery drawer already contains a wooden spoon, which suggests it is used for storing kitchen utensils. However, a pot is usually stored in a cupboard or on a shelf. Since the cupboard is currently empty, it would be a suitable place to store the clean pot.

Next action: put clean pot in cupboard
