Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom and have a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory. To improve my score, I need to find the appropriate location for the clean plaid polo shirt. In a bedroom, a wardrobe or a chest of drawers would be suitable places to store clothing items. Since I have the option to put an object on a supporter or in a container, and the wardrobe or chest of drawers are likely containers, I should choose to put the clean plaid polo shirt in one of them.

Next action: put clean plaid polo shirt in wardrobe

Consideration: I need to identify any items in the current environment that are not in their proper locations and then decide where they should be placed to improve my score. The current environment is the bedroom, and I should look for items that belong in other rooms or need to be organized within the bedroom itself.

Next action: Since the wardrobe already contains the plaid polo shirt, I should check if there are any other items in the bedroom that need to be moved. However, the current environment description does not list any misplaced items. Therefore, I should explore other areas to find items that need organizing. The next logical step is to explore further by going east.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe already contains several items of clothing, so I should look for any items in the bedroom that are out of place and need to be put away. Since the chest of drawers is empty, I should check if there are any items that belong there. If there are no items in the bedroom that need to be put away, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be organized.
