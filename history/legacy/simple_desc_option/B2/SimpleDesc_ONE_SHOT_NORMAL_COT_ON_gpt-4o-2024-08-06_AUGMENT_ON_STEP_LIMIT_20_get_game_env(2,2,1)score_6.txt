Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and I have a clean white pullover in my inventory. The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score.

Consideration: I need to identify items in the current environment that are not in their proper locations and move them to where they belong. The wardrobe already contains a clean white pullover, which is correctly placed. The chest of drawers contains a brown suit and a blue coat, which are also likely in the right place. The bed is currently empty, so there are no misplaced items there. Since there are no items in the bedroom that need to be moved, I should explore other areas to find items that need to be placed correctly.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. In the living room, I see a black coat on the sofa, a brown coat and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Coats are typically hung on a coat rack or placed in a wardrobe, while clean clothes like the teal skirt and gray polo shirt should be placed in a wardrobe. Since I am currently in the living room and have no items in my inventory, I should start by taking an item that needs to be relocated.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and my inventory is empty. The wardrobe already contains a brown suit, blue coat, black coat, and white pullover. The chest of drawers is empty, and the bed is also empty. Since my goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve my score, I should explore other areas to find items that need to be placed correctly.
