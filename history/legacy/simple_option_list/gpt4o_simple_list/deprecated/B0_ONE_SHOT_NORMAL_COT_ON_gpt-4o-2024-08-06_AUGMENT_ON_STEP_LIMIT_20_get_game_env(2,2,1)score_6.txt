Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. In the living room, I see a black coat on the sofa, a brown coat on the armchair, a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Coats are typically hung on a coat rack, which might be in the corridor. The clean teal skirt and clean gray polo shirt should likely be placed in a wardrobe or closet. Since I am currently in the living room and there is no wardrobe or coat rack here, I should first take the items with me to a location where they can be properly placed.

Consideration: I need to identify items in the living room that can be placed in their proper locations to increase my score. Currently, I see a brown coat and a clean teal skirt on the armchair, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor.

However, I need to take it first before I can move it to the wardrobe.
