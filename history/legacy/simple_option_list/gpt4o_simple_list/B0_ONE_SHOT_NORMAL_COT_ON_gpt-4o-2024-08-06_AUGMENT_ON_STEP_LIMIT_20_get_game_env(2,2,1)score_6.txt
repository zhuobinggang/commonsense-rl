Consideration: I need to put items in their appropriate locations to increase my score. Currently, I have a clean teal skirt in my inventory. In the living room, there is a bookcase, a sofa with a black coat, a coffee table, an armchair with a brown coat, and a clean gray polo shirt on the floor. Since the clean teal skirt is a clothing item, it would be best placed in a wardrobe or similar storage area. However, there is no wardrobe in the living room. I should explore other areas to find a suitable place for the skirt. The north direction is not blocked by a door, so I can explore further by going north.
