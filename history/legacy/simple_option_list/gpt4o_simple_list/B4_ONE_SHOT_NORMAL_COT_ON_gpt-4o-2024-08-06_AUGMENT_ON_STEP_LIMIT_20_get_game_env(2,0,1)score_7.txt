Consideration: I am currently in the backyard. There is a clean pot on the workbench, which should be placed in the kitchen, likely in a cupboard or on a shelf. The BBQ has a wooden spoon on it, which might belong in the kitchen as well. My goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. Since I am in the backyard and there is an open sliding patio door leading west to the kitchen, I should first take the clean pot from the workbench so I can move it to the kitchen.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and I have a clean pot in my inventory. The backyard has a BBQ, a clothesline with wet clothes, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench, but none of these seem like appropriate places for a clean pot. The most logical place for a clean pot would be in the kitchen, likely in a cupboard or on a kitchen counter. To get to the kitchen, I need to go west through the open sliding patio door.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and my inventory is empty. The kitchen contains a fridge, a kitchen cupboard, a dishwasher, a trash can, an oven, a dining table, a ladderback chair, a counter, a stove, and a dining chair. The fridge contains milk, the kitchen cupboard contains a clean pot, and the dishwasher contains a dirty cake slice and a dirty pot. The trash can, oven, dining table, ladderback chair, counter, stove, and dining chair are all empty. There is an open sliding patio door leading east. Since my goal is to put things in their proper locations and improve my score, I should focus on organizing the items in the kitchen. The dishwasher contains dirty items, which is appropriate, and the clean pot is already in the kitchen cupboard, which is also appropriate. The fridge contains milk, which is correct. Since there are no other items to organize in the kitchen, I should explore other areas to find more items to organize.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains some milk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard contains a clean pot. You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. What a letdown! The cutlery drawer is empty! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a dishwasher. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The dishwasher contains a dirty cake slice and a dirty pot. You can see an opened trash can nearby. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an oven. Huh, weird. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a dining chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.There is an open sliding patio door leading east.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a wooden spoon. I need to find the appropriate place to put the wooden spoon to increase my score. In a kitchen setting, a wooden spoon is typically stored in a cutlery drawer or a kitchen cupboard. However, the cutlery drawer is empty, and the kitchen cupboard already contains a clean pot. Since the cutlery drawer is empty, it might be the right place to put the wooden spoon.

Next action: put wooden spoon in cutlery drawer
