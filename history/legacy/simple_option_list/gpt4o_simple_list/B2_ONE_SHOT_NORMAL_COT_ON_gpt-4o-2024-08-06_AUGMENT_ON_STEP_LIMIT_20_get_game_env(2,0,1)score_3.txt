Consideration: To improve my score, I need to put items in their proper locations. Currently, I am in the backyard and I see a wet white jumper on the patio chair. The wet white jumper should be placed in a clothes drier to dry it, but there is no clothes drier in the backyard. I should take the wet white jumper with me and find a clothes drier. Additionally, I have some milk in my inventory, which might need to be placed in a refrigerator or similar container, but I don't see any such container here.

Consideration: I need to put the wet white jumper in the correct location to improve my score. The dishwasher is not the right place for it, as indicated by the previous wrong action. Typically, wet clothes should be placed in a clothes drier. However, there is no clothes drier in the current environment, which is the kitchen. I should explore other rooms to find a clothes drier. The only available direction to move is east, which leads to the backyard. I should explore further to find the correct location for the wet white jumper.

Consideration: I need to find the right location for the wet white jumper, which I mistakenly placed in the dishwasher. Since the current environment is the backyard, and there is a clothesline here, it would be logical to hang the wet white jumper on the clothesline to dry. However, I need to retrieve the wet white jumper from the dishwasher first. Since I am currently in the backyard, I need to go back to the kitchen to retrieve the jumper from the dishwasher.

Consideration: I need to put items in their correct locations to increase my score. Currently, I have some milk in my inventory, and I am in the kitchen. There is a wet white jumper in the dishwasher, which is not the correct place for it. I should take the wet white jumper out of the dishwasher and find a more appropriate place for it, likely in a clothes drier or on a clothesline. Additionally, there is a wet azure skirt on the dining chair, which should also be placed in a clothes drier or on a clothesline. However, I need to focus on one action at a time. Since I am in the kitchen and the wet white jumper is in the dishwasher, I should first take the wet white jumper out of the dishwasher.

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and I have some milk in my inventory. The backyard has a BBQ, a clothesline, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot on it. The milk needs to be placed in an appropriate location to improve my score. Since the clean pot is on the workbench and is not a container, I should consider moving to another room where there might be a suitable container for the milk. The open sliding patio door leads west, which might take me to a room with a suitable container.
