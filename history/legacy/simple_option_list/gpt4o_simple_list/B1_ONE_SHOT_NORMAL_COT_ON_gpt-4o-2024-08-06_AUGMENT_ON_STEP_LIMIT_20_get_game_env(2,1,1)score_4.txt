3. The gray coat is on the armchair, the brown suit is on the end table, and the dictionary is on the coffee table. These items might need to be moved to their correct locations.
4. The clean white polo shirt is on the floor, which is likely not its correct location.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and the wardrobe already contains a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper, and a clean plaid polo shirt. The chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, dark carpet, desk, and dressing table are all empty. Since I have nothing in my inventory, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations to improve my score. The only available exit is to the east, which leads back to the living room.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and there are two items that I can interact with: a gray coat on the armchair and a brown suit on the end table. Since I have previously placed clean clothing items in the wardrobe in the bedroom, it is likely that the brown suit should also be placed in the wardrobe. The gray coat might also belong in the wardrobe, but I should focus on one item at a time. I will start by taking the brown suit, as it is on the end table and might be more appropriate for the wardrobe.

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a gray coat in my inventory. Based on previous actions, it seems that clothing items should be placed in the wardrobe, which is located in the bedroom. To reach the bedroom, I need to go west from the living room. Therefore, my next step should be to move to the bedroom so I can place the gray coat in the wardrobe and increase my score.

Next action: go west

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a brown suit, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom and carrying a gray coat. The wardrobe in the bedroom already contains several clothing items, so it seems like the appropriate place to store clothes. Since the gray coat is a clothing item, it would be logical to put it in the wardrobe to increase my score.
