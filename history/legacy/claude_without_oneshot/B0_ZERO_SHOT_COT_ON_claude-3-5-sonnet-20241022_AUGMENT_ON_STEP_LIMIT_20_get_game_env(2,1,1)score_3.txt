You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean plaid polo shirt, which is a clothing item
2) Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where clothes could be stored:
   - A wardrobe (traditional place for hanging clothes)
   - A chest of drawers (good for folded clothes)
   - A bed (not proper storage)
   - Other surfaces (desk, chair, etc. - not proper storage)

3) Among these options:
   - Wardrobe is the most appropriate place for hanging clothes
   - It's already opened, making it convenient
   - Wardrobes are specifically designed for storing clothes

4) Therefore, putting the shirt in the wardrobe would be the most logical choice to properly organize the room and likely improve the score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve the score
2) Looking at the current state:
   - There's a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe
   - I already got 1 point for putting it there (from action history)
   - Most other furniture items are empty
   - The shirt is already in a proper location (wardrobe is meant for clothes)

3) Considerations:
   - Since I got a point for putting the shirt in the wardrobe, that was the right move
   - The shirt is currently in its correct place
   - Taking it out would likely lose points
   - No other items are available to move around
   - Might need to explore more to find other items

4) Given these factors:
   - I shouldn't move the shirt since it's in the right place
   - I should probably explore to find more items to organize
   - The only available direction is east

Consideration: Since the only item is already properly placed, and there's nothing else to organize in this room, I should explore other areas to find more items to sort.

Next action: go east

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.There is a clean white polo shirt on the floor.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several clothing items and furniture:
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - clean white polo shirt on floor
   - dictionary on coffee table

2) From the previous action where putting a shirt in the wardrobe gave a point, I can deduce:
   - Clothing items likely belong in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is in the room to the west (where we came from)

3) To maximize score:
   - All clothing items should be moved to the wardrobe
   - Need to pick up items before moving them
   - Can only carry one item at a time

4) Strategy:
   - Pick up one clothing item
   - Go west to wardrobe
   - Put it in wardrobe
   - Repeat for other clothing items

5) Starting with the item on the floor is logical as it's not properly placed anywhere:

Consideration: The clean white polo shirt is on the floor, which is clearly not its proper place. Since we know clothing goes in the wardrobe (from previous success), we should pick this up first.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

3) In the previous room, I successfully put a polo shirt in the wardrobe and got a point
4) However, I don't see a wardrobe in this room
5) The available storage locations are:
   - bookcase

6) Since I got a point for putting clothing in a wardrobe before, I should go back to that room
7) The description mentions I can go west, which is back to the previous room where the wardrobe was

Consideration: Since clothing belongs in a wardrobe, and I got a point for doing that before, I should return to the room with the wardrobe to properly store the white polo shirt.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I have a clean white polo shirt in my inventory
2) From the previous action where I got a point for putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, I can deduce that clothing items belong in storage furniture
3) In this room, there are two storage furniture pieces:
   - wardrobe (already contains the plaid polo shirt)
   - chest of drawers (currently empty)
4) Since both are storage furniture for clothes, either might be correct
5) However, since the wardrobe already has a similar item (another polo shirt), it's likely that's the intended storage location
6) The game rewarded putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, so it's logical that the white polo shirt belongs there too

Consideration: Based on the pattern of getting a point for putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, and the fact that both items are polo shirts, the white polo shirt likely belongs in the wardrobe as well.

2) Looking at the current environment, I see several clothing items:
   - brown suit on the end table
   - clean checkered jumper on the sofa
   - gray coat on the armchair

3) The dictionary is not a clothing item, so it likely belongs somewhere else (maybe the bookcase).

4) To maximize score, I need to move clothing items to the wardrobe.

5) I can only carry one item at a time, so I need to take one piece of clothing first.

6) Any of the clothing items would be a valid choice, but let's be systematic and start with the first one mentioned.

   - bookcase
   - wastepaper basket
   - TV stand
   - armchair
   - coffee table
   - end table
   - grey carpet
   - side table
   - sofa

3) From previous text games experience:
   - Suits typically belong in wardrobes or closets
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
   - None of the locations in this room seem appropriate for a suit

4) Given that:
   - We successfully put shirts in the wardrobe before
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom
   - A suit is also a clothing item

Therefore, I should:
Next action: go west

This will take me back to the bedroom where I can try to put the brown suit in the wardrobe, which is likely its proper location.

Consideration: <fill in>

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently carrying a brown suit and need to put it somewhere proper

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations:
- wardrobe (currently contains polo shirts)
- chest of drawers (empty)
- desk (empty)
- dressing table (empty)
- bed (empty)
- nightstand (empty)

3) Considering what would be most logical:
- A wardrobe is typically used to store clothes, especially formal wear like suits
- The fact that other clothes (polo shirts) are already in the wardrobe suggests it's the right place
- Previous actions with the polo shirts in the wardrobe increased the score

4) Therefore, putting the brown suit in the wardrobe is likely to be the correct action and increase the score

Consideration: The wardrobe seems to be the most appropriate storage location for clothing items, and previous actions confirm this increases the score.

Next action: insert brown suit into wardrobe

But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state:
- We have successfully put 3 clothing items in the wardrobe (brown suit, clean white polo shirt, clean plaid polo shirt)
- All these items are in their correct location (we got points for each)
- The wardrobe is currently open
- Other furniture pieces (chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, desk, dressing table) are empty

2) Analyzing the situation:
- We've already placed all visible clothing items in their proper place
- We got points for each correct placement
- There don't seem to be any more items to organize
- The wardrobe is still open and contains all the properly placed items

3) Best practice in organizing:
- When you're done putting things away in a storage unit like a wardrobe
- It's generally good practice to close it
- We previously closed it but then opened it again to check contents

4) Next logical step:
- Since all items are properly stored
- And we've verified the contents
- We should close the wardrobe to complete our organization task

Consideration: The wardrobe contains all the clothing items in their proper place and we've verified the contents. The logical next step is to close it.

3) Current situation:
   - I'm in the bedroom
   - I have nothing in my inventory
   - There are several furniture pieces but they're all empty
   - The wardrobe contains all the clothes I've stored

4) Considering possible actions:
   - Most examine actions won't help progress since items are empty
   - Going east would just take me back to the livingroom
   - Opening the wardrobe might help me check if there's anything else I need to organize

5) Decision:
   - Since I'm not sure if I've completed all clothing organization
   - It would be smart to check what's in the wardrobe to confirm

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see a closed wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2) Looking at my action history:
   - I've already put 3 clothing items in the wardrobe (plaid polo shirt, white polo shirt, brown suit)
   - Each correct placement gave me 1 point
3) Current environment shows several furniture pieces:
   - Most are noted as empty (chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, desk, dressing table)
   - The wardrobe contains the clothes I put in
4) Since I've already placed items in the wardrobe successfully, I should check if there are any other items in the room
5) The best way to thoroughly check the room is to examine each piece of furniture

Consideration: Since I haven't examined the chest of drawers yet, and it's one of the main storage furniture pieces in a bedroom, I should check it first to see if there are any items that need to be properly placed.

Next action: examine chest of drawers

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state:
- We have a wardrobe containing 3 items: brown suit, clean white polo shirt, and clean plaid polo shirt
- We got points previously for putting these items in the wardrobe
- All other furniture pieces (chest of drawers, bed, desk, etc.) are empty
- The wardrobe seems to be the correct storage location for clothes

2) Analyzing the score history:
- We got points for putting each clothing item in the wardrobe
- This suggests the wardrobe is indeed the right place for these items

3) Current situation:
- All items appear to be in their correct locations (the wardrobe)
- We received points for each placement
- Nothing seems out of place

4) Possible actions:
- We could examine items to learn more
- We could move items around, but since they're already in the correct place, this would likely lower our score
- We could explore other areas by going east

Consideration: Since all clothing items are already in their proper location (wardrobe) and we've received points for each, there's no immediate need to move them. The best course of action would be to explore other areas to find more items that might need proper placement.

Next action: go east

Inventory: You are carrying nothing.
Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
Action you can take:
* close bookcase
* close wastepaper basket

Consideration: <fill in>

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items that could potentially be stored:
   - clean checkered jumper (on sofa)
   - gray coat (on armchair)
   - dictionary (on coffee table)

2) Based on previous actions, I know:
   - Clothes go in the wardrobe (as we put polo shirts and suit there)
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)

3) Since we're organizing things, and we've been successful with putting clothes in the wardrobe:
   - The clean checkered jumper and gray coat should go in the wardrobe
   - The dictionary might belong in the bookcase

4) Looking at the items' current locations:
   - The clean checkered jumper is closest and is clothing
   - We should continue with the pattern of storing clothes

5) Therefore:
   - We should first take the clean checkered jumper
   - Then we can go west to put it in the wardrobe

Consideration: Taking the clean checkered jumper is the logical next step as it's clothing that should go in the wardrobe, following the pattern of previous successful actions that earned points.

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from sofa
