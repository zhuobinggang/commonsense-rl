Consideration: I need to put items in their appropriate locations to increase my score. Currently, I have a pair of wet plaid socks in my inventory. In the laundry room, there is a clothes drier, which is the appropriate place for wet items. There are also a pair of wet white panties, a dirty magenta skirt, and a dirty striped pullover on the floor. The wet white panties should go into the clothes drier, while the dirty magenta skirt and dirty striped pullover should go into the washing machine. However, since I can only perform one action at a time, I should focus on placing the wet plaid socks in the clothes drier first to increase my score.
