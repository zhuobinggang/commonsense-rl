Consideration: I am currently in the backyard, and I have some milk in my inventory. The backyard has a BBQ, a clothesline with wet clothes, a patio chair, a patio table, and a workbench with a clean pot. The milk should be placed in a refrigerator or a similar storage location to keep it fresh. Since there is no refrigerator in the backyard, I should explore other areas to find a suitable place for the milk. The open sliding patio door leads west, which might take me to a kitchen or another room where I can store the milk properly.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen, and I need to find the correct location for the dirty cake slice, which is currently in the trash can. Since the trash can is not the right place for it, I should consider other locations where food waste might be disposed of or processed. The dishwasher is already occupied with a dirty pot, and the fridge is not suitable for a dirty cake slice. The kitchen cupboard, cutlery drawer, oven, dining table, ladderback chair, counter, stove, and dining chair are all empty and not appropriate for disposing of a dirty cake slice. I should explore other rooms to find a more suitable location for the dirty cake slice.

Consideration: I am currently in the kitchen and carrying a dirty cake slice. The trash can in the kitchen was not the correct place for the dirty cake slice, as indicated by the previous wrong action. Since the kitchen is not the right place for the dirty cake slice, I should consider moving to another room where it might belong. The only available direction to go is east, which leads to the backyard. I should explore the backyard to see if there is a more appropriate place for the dirty cake slice.

Next action: go east

Consideration: I am currently in the backyard and I have a dirty cake slice in my inventory. The dirty cake slice should be disposed of properly. Since the trash can in the kitchen was not the right place, I need to find another location for it. The backyard doesn't seem to have any suitable containers for disposing of the dirty cake slice.
