You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: I am currently in a bedroom with a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory. The room is empty, and there are no obvious places to put the shirt. However, I can go east to explore other areas where the shirt might belong. Since the wardrobe, chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, dark carpet, desk, and dressing table are all empty, it seems unlikely that the shirt belongs in this room. The best course of action is to explore further by going east to find a more suitable location for the shirt.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a clean plaid polo shirt in my inventory. The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. In the living room, there are several pieces of furniture, but none seem appropriate for placing a clean plaid polo shirt. The living room is not typically where clothes are stored, so I should consider moving to another room where clothes are more appropriately placed, such as a bedroom or closet. The only available direction to move is west, which might lead to a more suitable location for the shirt.

You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table?

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a clean checkered jumper in my inventory. The goal is to put items in their proper locations to improve my score. The living room has a sofa, armchair, side table, TV stand, end table, and coffee table, but none of these seem like the appropriate place for a clean checkered jumper. Based on previous actions, clean clothing items are best placed in a wardrobe, which is likely located in the bedroom to the west.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and I have already placed all the clean clothes in the wardrobe, which is the correct location for them. My inventory is empty, and there are no other items in the bedroom that need to be moved. To continue improving my score, I should explore other rooms to find items that need to be placed in their proper locations. The only available exit from the bedroom is to go east, which will take me back to the living room. From there, I can look for more items to organize.

To do this, I need to take the items first and then move to the bedroom to place them in the wardrobe.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I see a brown suit on the end table and a dictionary on the coffee table. Since the brown suit is likely a piece of clothing, it should probably be placed in the wardrobe in the bedroom, which is to the west. The dictionary, being a book, might belong on a bookshelf or similar location, but since the bookcase here is empty, it might be best to leave it for now. My inventory is currently empty, so I can take the brown suit with me to the bedroom.

Current enviroment: -= Livingroom =-You are in a livingroom. A normal one. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the armchair! oh well. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. But there isn't a thing on it. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: I am currently in the living room and I have a brown suit in my inventory. Based on previous actions, it seems that clothing items should be placed in the wardrobe, which is located in the bedroom. To reach the bedroom, I need to go west from the living room. Therefore, my next step should be to move to the bedroom so I can place the brown suit in the wardrobe and increase my score.

Next action: go west

The wardrobe contains a gray coat, a clean white polo shirt, a clean checkered jumper and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Consideration: I am currently in the bedroom, and I have a brown suit in my inventory. The wardrobe in the bedroom already contains several clothing items, which suggests it is the appropriate place for clothing. Since the brown suit is a clothing item, it would be logical to place it in the wardrobe to increase my score.

Next action: put brown suit in wardrobe
