Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean white pullover in my inventory
2. There are two storage locations: wardrobe and chest of drawers
3. Generally, clean clothes should be stored in a wardrobe or dresser
4. Looking at the chest of drawers, it already contains formal wear (suit and coat)
5. The wardrobe is empty and is a proper storage place for casual wear like a pullover

Based on this analysis, I should put the clean white pullover in the wardrobe, as it's:
- A proper storage location for clean clothes
- Currently empty
- Makes logical sense for organizing clothes (casual wear in wardrobe)

Next action: insert clean white pullover into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have clothing items in two storage furniture pieces: wardrobe and chest of drawers.
2. The clean white pullover is already in the wardrobe and gave us a point, so that's in the right place.
3. We have a brown suit and a blue coat in the chest of drawers.
4. Generally, suits and coats should be hung up in a wardrobe to prevent wrinkles and maintain their shape.
5. Therefore, either the brown suit or blue coat should be moved to the wardrobe.
6. Let's start with the suit since it's typically more formal and more important to keep properly hung.

Next action: take brown suit from chest of drawers

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a brown suit in my inventory
2. The goal is to put things in their proper locations
3. Looking at the environment, there are several possible storage locations:
   - wardrobe (contains clean white pullover)
   - chest of drawers (contains blue coat)
   - bed

4. Since this is a suit, and suits are typically hung up to prevent wrinkles, the wardrobe would be the most appropriate storage location.

5. Previous action that increased the score was putting the clean white pullover in the wardrobe, which suggests the wardrobe is a correct location for clothing.

Therefore, I choose:

Next action: insert brown suit into wardrobe

This action makes the most sense because:
1. Wardrobes are proper storage for suits
2. We've already seen that putting clothing in the wardrobe can increase our score
3. It follows the pattern of putting things in their logical places

   - A chest of drawers containing a blue coat
3. From previous successful actions, we know:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe
   - The blue coat in the chest of drawers might need to be moved to the wardrobe

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take blue coat from chest of drawers

Reasoning: Since clean clothes belong in the wardrobe (as shown by the white pullover and brown suit being there), the blue coat should probably also go in the wardrobe. The first step is to take it from the chest of drawers.

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, we want to organize clothing items properly. The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes and formal wear, as evidenced by getting points for putting the clean white pullover and brown suit there.

Since we're holding a blue coat (which is also a formal outerwear item like the brown suit), we should:

Next action: insert blue coat into wardrobe

This action follows the same pattern as the previous successful actions with formal wear, and should increase our score by putting the coat in its proper storage location.

Looking at the current state, I notice that all the clothes (blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover) are already in their proper location (the wardrobe), and we've already received points for putting them there. The chest of drawers and wardrobe are both open, but since we're done using them, it would be good practice to close them.

Next action: close wardrobe

Reasoning: Since we've finished putting all clothes in the wardrobe and don't need to access it anymore, we should close it. This is a tidy way to finish up in this room, and might potentially give us additional points for proper organization.

2. Looking at the current environment:
   - The wardrobe is closed
   - The chest of drawers is open but empty
   - The bed has nothing on it
3. Looking at my inventory:
   - I'm not carrying anything
4. From the example walkthrough:
   - Clothes generally belong in specific places
   - The wardrobe seems to be a proper place for clean clothes
5. Since the wardrobe is closed and might contain more items to organize:
   - I should check what's inside the wardrobe

Next action: open wardrobe

This is the best next action because:
- I need to see if there are any items in the wardrobe that need to be moved
- The wardrobe has been a proper storage location for clothes based on previous actions
- I can't make progress with organizing items if I can't see what's in the wardrobe

Looking at the current state, all the clothes (blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover) are already in their proper location in the wardrobe, and we've already gotten points for putting them there. The chest of drawers is empty, and there's nothing on the bed that needs to be moved.

Since everything in this room is already in its proper place and there's nothing more to organize here, the logical next step would be to:

Next action: go south

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.
Next action: <fill in>


Looking at the previous actions and the current environment, I notice that:
1. We were previously putting clean clothes into the wardrobe in another room
2. There are several clean clothing items here (black coat, brown coat, clean gray polo shirt, clean teal skirt)
3. We need to collect these items and take them to the wardrobe

Therefore, I should start collecting these clean clothes to eventually put them in the wardrobe. Let's start with:

Next action: take black coat from sofa

This is a good first step because:
1. The black coat is a clean item that belongs in the wardrobe
2. We need to collect it before we can transport it
3. It follows the pattern from earlier actions where we were putting coats and other clean clothes into the wardrobe

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a black coat in my inventory
2. There's a bookcase, armchair, sofa, and coffee table in the room
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machines
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Coats might belong in a wardrobe or on a coat rack

4. Since there's a bookcase that was revealed by a secret button, and it's specifically mentioned that it's empty, this seems like a special location that might be intended for something.

5. Given that I have a black coat and there's an empty bookcase, trying to put the coat in the bookcase might be worth attempting, especially since it's one of the available actions.

Next action: insert black coat into bookcase

This seems like the most logical choice because:
1. The bookcase was revealed through a secret button, suggesting it's important
2. It's explicitly mentioned as being empty, suggesting it needs to be filled
3. It's one of the available actions, indicating it might be a valid solution
4. Coats are typically stored in storage furniture

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1. From the example walkthrough, I see that clothes should be put in their proper locations to get points.
2. From the previous actions, I notice that clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe, which is in the room to the north.
3. Currently in the livingroom, I see several clean items:
   - clean gray polo shirt on the floor
   - clean teal skirt on the armchair
   - brown coat on the armchair
4. The black coat is in the bookcase, which was noted as the wrong position in the previous action.
5. Since clean clothes belong in the wardrobe, and we need to go north to reach it, we should first collect the clean items.

Therefore, I should start by picking up one of the clean items.

Next action: take clean teal skirt from armchair

Reasoning: I'm choosing to take the clean teal skirt first because it's a clean item that should go in the wardrobe, and we know from the example that putting items in their proper place increases our score.

Let me think about this step by step:

2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - The wardrobe is in the room to the north
3. I'm currently in the livingroom and can see a "go north" option
4. I also have a black coat in the bookcase that was indicated to be in the wrong place

Therefore, I should first go north to access the wardrobe where I can properly store the clean teal skirt.

Next action: go north

This is the best action because:
1. It will take me back to the room with the wardrobe
2. Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe (as shown in the example with the clean white pullover)
3. This will allow me to properly store the clean teal skirt and improve my score

Looking at the available actions and considering that I'm carrying a clean teal skirt, I should put it in the wardrobe since:
1. The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes (as evidenced by the other clean items already stored there)
2. Previous successful score-increasing actions included putting clothing items in the wardrobe
3. The skirt is clean, so it belongs with other clean clothes

Looking at the action history, I notice that the black coat was taken from the sofa but was incorrectly placed in the bookcase. Since we're in the bedroom with access to the wardrobe (which is the proper place for coats and clothing), and we need to improve our score, we should go south to retrieve the black coat and bring it back to put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. The black coat is currently in the wrong location (bookcase)
2. We need to go to the livingroom (south) to get it
3. Then we can bring it back to put it in its proper place (wardrobe) to improve our score
4. None of the other actions would help improve our score right now, as all items currently in the wardrobe are already in their correct positions

Let me think about this step by step:

1. From the example walkthrough, I know that clothes generally belong in proper storage locations like wardrobes.

2. From the action history, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes and coats belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (north)
   - Putting clothes in the bookcase was wrong

3. In the current environment, I see:
   - A black coat in the bookcase (which was previously put there incorrectly)
   - A brown coat on the armchair
   - A clean gray polo shirt on the floor

4. Since the black coat is in the wrong place (bookcase), and we know coats belong in the wardrobe, I should first:

Next action: take black coat from bookcase

This will allow me to later move it to its proper location in the wardrobe in the bedroom.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a black coat in my inventory that I previously tried to put in the bookcase, but that was wrong.
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that clothing items generally belong in proper storage furniture like wardrobes, washing machines, or clothes driers.
3. The wardrobe is in the bedroom (north of here).
4. Since the black coat appears to be a regular piece of clothing (not dirty or wet), it should probably go in the wardrobe like the other coats we saw earlier.
5. Therefore, I should first go north to the bedroom to access the wardrobe.

Next action: go north

This is the best next action because:
1. It moves us toward the wardrobe, which is the proper storage location for coats
2. We've seen from previous actions that putting coats in the wardrobe increases our score
3. The previous attempt to put the black coat in the bookcase was explicitly wrong, so we need to try a different location

Looking at the history and the fact that I'm holding a black coat, and seeing that other clean clothes like the teal skirt, blue coat, brown suit, and white pullover are properly stored in the wardrobe, I should:

Next action: insert black coat into wardrobe

Reasoning: 
1. The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes/outerwear
2. Previously when I tried to put the black coat in the bookcase, I got a message saying "Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room"
3. All other clean clothing items that have been properly placed (earning points) are in the wardrobe
4. The black coat is likely clean since it was found in the living room (not in laundry)
5. This action should improve the score like the other similar clothing storage actions did

Looking at the current state, all the clothing items in the wardrobe (black coat, clean teal skirt, blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover) are already in their correct positions as indicated by the previous score increases. The chest of drawers and bed are empty.

Since everything is properly stored, the best action would be to:

Next action: close wardrobe

Reasoning: Since all clothes are properly stored in the wardrobe and we've confirmed they're in the right place (based on score increases), we should close the wardrobe to keep things tidy. This is a common practice in text adventure games - closing containers after you're done using them.

Looking at the current state, all the clothes in the wardrobe (black coat, clean teal skirt, blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover) are already in their correct positions as indicated by the previous score increases. The chest of drawers is empty, and there's nothing else to organize.

Since everything is already in its proper place, the most logical action would be to:

Next action: close wardrobe

Reasoning: Since all items are properly stored in the wardrobe and we've verified their placement (by opening it earlier), we should close it to maintain tidiness. This is a common practice in organizing spaces - once items are properly stored, we should close storage units.

* open wardrobe

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this...

The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve the score. Looking at the current state:
1. The wardrobe is closed and contains properly placed items (black coat, clean teal skirt, blue coat, brown suit, clean white pullover)
2. The chest of drawers is open but empty
3. The bed is empty
4. I'm not carrying any items

Since there are no items to move right now, and the chest of drawers is already open but empty, the most logical action would be to:

Next action: close chest of drawers

Reasoning: Since the chest of drawers is empty and open, we should close it for tidiness. While this may not directly improve the score, it's good practice to keep furniture closed when not in use, and it might be required for full completion of the game.
