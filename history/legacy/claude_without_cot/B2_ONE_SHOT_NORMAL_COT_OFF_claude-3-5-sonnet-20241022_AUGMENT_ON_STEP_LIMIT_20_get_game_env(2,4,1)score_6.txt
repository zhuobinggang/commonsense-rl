The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have several clothing items:
- A pair of blue moccasins (in inventory)
- A pair of brown moccasins (on nightstand)
- A clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
- A clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
- Shoes might have a specific place

3. Since we have an open wardrobe and chest of drawers, and we're carrying blue moccasins, we should try storing them in one of these storage locations.

4. The wardrobe is typically used for hanging clothes, while drawers are more appropriate for shoes.

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: insert blue moccasins into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical action to try to improve our score by putting the shoes in an appropriate storage location.

Looking at the previous action where putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, and considering we need to put things in their proper locations, I should first take the blue moccasins back from the chest of drawers.

Next action: take blue moccasins from chest of drawers

Reasoning:
1. The game indicated that putting blue moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong ("Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room")
2. To fix this mistake, we first need to take the blue moccasins back
3. Once we have them in our inventory, we can then try to find their proper location, likely in another room as suggested by the game's hint

Looking at the example walkthrough, I notice that clothing items should be put in their proper storage locations. Since I'm holding blue moccasins (shoes), and looking at the example where clothing items were organized properly, I should try to find a shoe storage location.

The current room (bedroom) doesn't seem to have a dedicated shoe storage area. In the example walkthrough, there was movement between rooms to put items in their proper places. Therefore, I should:

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. I need to find a more appropriate location for the blue moccasins
2. The example showed that items often need to be moved to different rooms to be placed correctly
3. The south direction is available and might lead to a room with proper shoe storage
4. My previous attempt to put the moccasins in the chest of drawers was wrong, confirming they belong somewhere else

Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet is empty! What a waste of a day! You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying blue moccasins, which are shoes
2. I see a shoe cabinet in the corridor, which is a logical place for shoes
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that items should be placed in appropriate locations (like hats on hat rack)
4. The shoe cabinet is specifically designed for storing shoes

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

This makes the most sense because:
- Shoes belong in a shoe cabinet
- It's a logical storage location for footwear
- Other options like putting shoes on a hat rack or key holder wouldn't be proper placement
- The example shows that putting items in their proper locations increases the score

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
- clean white skirt on coat hanger
- clean white socks on floor
- blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)

2. Based on the example walkthrough:
- Clothes typically go on hangers/racks
- Shoes go in shoe cabinet
- The blue moccasins are already in the right place

3. Looking at the items:
- The clean white socks are on the floor, which isn't a proper storage place
- The white skirt is already on a coat hanger, which seems correct
- We should probably pick up the socks first to put them away properly

Therefore, I think we should:

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning: We should pick up the socks from the floor first since items on the floor generally need to be put away properly. Once we have them, we can explore to find the proper storage location for them (likely in a drawer or similar storage).

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations: shoe cabinet, hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, and coat hanger
3. Given that this is a corridor and these are socks (clothing item), the most logical place would be the coat hanger where other clothing (white skirt) is stored
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that clothing items typically go on clothing storage furniture
5. The coat hanger is already being used appropriately for storing a skirt, so it makes sense it would be the right place for socks too

Next action: put clean white socks on coat hanger

This seems like the most logical choice because:
- Socks are clothing items like the skirt already properly stored there
- The coat hanger is meant for storing clothing
- Other storage options (shoe cabinet, umbrella stand, key holder) don't make as much sense for storing socks

Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a pair of blue moccasins, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. On the coat hanger you can see a pair of clean white socks and a clean white skirt.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.

Looking at the situation, I notice the clean white socks are on the coat hanger, which was previously determined to be the wrong position. Since we need to put things in their proper locations, we should:

Next action: take clean white socks from coat hanger

Reasoning:
1. We know from the previous action history that clean white socks were wrongly placed on the coat hanger (Action 5)
2. Clean clothes like socks typically belong in a chest of drawers or similar storage
3. The other room (to the north) might have the proper storage for clean socks
4. First step is to take the socks so we can move them to the correct location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying clean white socks which need to be put somewhere proper
2. Looking at the environment, this is a corridor with storage furniture
3. Clean clothes typically belong in drawers or closets, not in corridor furniture
4. There's a room to the north that might be more appropriate
5. Since I need to find the proper location for the clean white socks, and this corridor doesn't seem like the right place, I should explore the other room

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: go north

This will let me explore the other room to find a more appropriate place for the clean white socks, since corridor furniture (shoe cabinet, hat rack, coat hanger) doesn't seem like the proper place for storing clean socks.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have clean white socks in my inventory
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like a wardrobe or chest of drawers
3. Looking at the example walkthrough, proper storage of items increases the score
4. Between wardrobe and chest of drawers, the chest of drawers seems more appropriate for socks

Therefore, I choose:
Next action: insert clean white socks into chest of drawers

This action makes sense because:
- The socks are clean, so they should be stored properly
- Chest of drawers is a common storage place for socks
- It follows the pattern from the example where putting items in their proper place increases the score

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, I see several items:
- brown moccasins on nightstand
- clean azure skirt on dressing table
- clean plaid pullover on nightstand
- clean white socks in chest of drawers

2. From the previous example walkthrough, I learned that:
- shoes (like moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
- clean clothes (like socks) belong in the chest of drawers

3. From the action history, I can see:
- blue moccasins were correctly placed in the shoe cabinet
- clean white socks were correctly placed in the chest of drawers

4. Therefore, since brown moccasins are shoes, they should go in the shoe cabinet like the blue moccasins did.

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

This is the best next action because:
1. We know shoes belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
2. We need to first take the moccasins before we can move them
3. This follows the same pattern as the successful blue moccasins example from the action history

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the example walkthrough, I notice that:
1. Shoes (like blue moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet
2. The brown moccasins I'm carrying are also shoes
3. The blue moccasins are already correctly placed in the shoe cabinet (got a point for that)

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

This is the most logical action because:
1. It follows the same pattern as the blue moccasins which got a point when placed in the shoe cabinet
2. The shoe cabinet is the proper storage location for footwear
3. This action will likely increase the score as it puts an item in its proper location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have a clean white skirt on a coat hanger.
2. From the example walkthrough, we know that:
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Clean clothes typically go in the chest of drawers in the bedroom
3. Since the clean white skirt is a clothing item and it's clean, it should probably go in the chest of drawers in the bedroom.
4. To move the skirt, we first need to take it.

Therefore, I should take the clean white skirt to move it to its proper location.

2. From the example walkthrough, I learned that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the chest of drawers
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack

3. Since this is a clean white skirt, it should probably go in the chest of drawers, which is in the bedroom

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes like skirts should go into the wardrobe or chest of drawers. Since I'm holding a clean white skirt, I should put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: insert clean white skirt into wardrobe

Reasoning:
1. Clean clothes belong in storage furniture in the bedroom
2. The wardrobe is a proper storage place for clothes like skirts
3. The item is already clean, so it doesn't need washing
4. Previous successful actions showed that clean items like socks went into the chest of drawers, so other clean clothes likely belong in bedroom storage furniture

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A clean azure skirt on the dressing table
   - A clean plaid pullover on the nightstand
   - A clean white skirt in the wardrobe (we just put it there)
   - Clean white socks in the chest of drawers (we just put them there)

2. Based on previous actions:
   - Clean clothes seem to belong in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - The clean white skirt and socks are already in their correct places (we got points for those)

3. Therefore:
   - We should move the clean azure skirt and clean plaid pullover to either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - Let's start with one of them

4. Decision:
   Let's take the clean azure skirt first since it's similar to the white skirt that we successfully put in the wardrobe.

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the example walkthrough, clean clothes like skirts typically belong in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a clean azure skirt, I should put it in the wardrobe.

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe

Let me explain why:
1. Clean clothes (especially dresses and skirts) have been consistently stored in the wardrobe, as shown by the clean white skirt being correctly placed there earlier
2. The wardrobe is a proper storage location for clean clothing items
3. The azure skirt is clean, so it belongs with other clean clothes
4. This action is likely to increase the score based on similar patterns in previous actions

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean azure skirt and a clean white skirt. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a pair of clean white socks. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand that hasn't been properly stored yet.

2. From previous actions, we know that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - Clean skirts went into the wardrobe
   - Clean socks went into the chest of drawers

3. Since the clean plaid pullover is a clothing item similar to skirts, it likely belongs in the wardrobe.

4. Therefore, the first step should be to take the clean plaid pullover so we can then move it to its proper location.

Next action: take clean plaid pullover from nightstand

This will allow us to then put it in the wardrobe in the next action, which should increase our score.

Looking at the pattern from previous actions and the current state, I notice:
1. Clean clothes (skirts, socks) belong in bedroom storage furniture (wardrobe, chest of drawers)
2. The clean plaid pullover is in my inventory
3. Since it's a clean clothing item, it likely belongs in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
4. Previous actions show that larger clothing items (skirts) went into the wardrobe

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert clean plaid pullover into wardrobe

This follows the pattern of putting clean clothing items in proper bedroom storage, with larger garments specifically going into the wardrobe.
