Inventory: You are carrying:  some milk
Current enviroment: -= Backyard =-You've entered a backyard.You see a BBQ. The BBQ is recent. On the BBQ you make out a wooden spoon. You see a clothesline. The clothesline is typical. But the thing is empty. Hm. Oh well What's that over there? It looks like it's a patio chair. Now why would someone leave that there? On the patio chair you can see a wet white jumper. You see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. The patio table appears to be empty. Hey, want to see a workbench? Look over there, a workbench. On the workbench you see a clean pot. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.There is an open sliding patio door leading west.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I see a wet white jumper on the patio chair - since it's wet, it should probably go on the clothesline to dry
2. The clean pot on the workbench might belong in the kitchen
3. The wooden spoon on the BBQ might also belong in the kitchen
4. The milk I'm carrying probably belongs in a refrigerator
5. Looking at these items, the most logical action to improve score would be to put the wet clothing on the clothesline

Therefore, I should:
Next action: take wet white jumper from patio chair

This is the best first step because:
- Wet clothes belong on clotheslines to dry
- After taking it, I can then put it on the clothesline in the next action
- This follows the pattern from the example walkthrough where we were organizing items in their proper places

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice I'm holding a wet white jumper. Since it's wet, it needs to be dried, and there's a clothesline which is the proper place for drying clothes.

Next action: put wet white jumper on clothesline

Reasoning: This is the most logical action because:
1. The wet white jumper needs to be dried
2. A clothesline is specifically designed for drying clothes
3. Based on the example walkthrough, putting items in their proper locations increases the score
4. The clothesline is currently empty and available
5. This follows the same logic as the example where wet clothes were put in appropriate drying locations (like the wet azure dress in the clothes drier)

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying milk, which is typically stored in a kitchen or refrigerator
2. The sliding patio door leads west, which likely leads inside the house
3. The milk shouldn't be left outside on any outdoor furniture
4. The clean pot on the workbench might need to go to the kitchen as well
5. The wet white jumper is already in the right place (clothesline) as confirmed by the previous score increase
6. The wooden spoon on the BBQ might need to go to the kitchen

Given these observations, I should first take the clean pot since it likely belongs in the kitchen, and we'll need to go inside anyway to properly store the milk.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean pot and milk in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there's a BBQ with a wooden spoon, which seems like a cooking area
3. The clean pot would logically belong in a cooking area
4. Among the available actions, "put clean pot on BBQ" seems most logical since pots are used for cooking and BBQ is a cooking surface

Therefore, I should choose:
Next action: put clean pot on BBQ

This action follows the game's logic of putting items in their proper locations to improve the score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I'm carrying milk, and there are several items visible in the backyard.
2. The clean pot was previously put on the BBQ and got a "Wrong position" message, suggesting it belongs somewhere else.
3. There's a sliding patio door leading west, which likely leads to the kitchen or another indoor room.
4. Milk is typically stored inside, not outside in a backyard.
5. The wooden spoon and clean pot on the BBQ are likely kitchen items that should be inside.

Given this analysis, I should:
1. Either take the remaining misplaced kitchen items (wooden spoon), or
2. Go inside with the milk to put it in its proper place, or
3. Take the clean pot again since it was wrongly placed.

Since we already know the clean pot was wrongly placed on the BBQ, let's take it back:

2. Looking at the environment, I see a fridge which is empty
3. From common sense, milk should be stored in a fridge to keep it fresh
4. Looking at the available actions, I can "insert milk into fridge"
5. This seems like the most logical action to improve the score since milk belongs in the fridge

Next action: insert milk into fridge

Looking at the available actions and considering the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice there's a clean pot in my inventory and a stove in the kitchen. Logically, pots belong on stoves for cooking.

Next action: put clean pot on stove

Reasoning: Since we have a clean pot and we're in a kitchen, the most logical place for a pot would be on the stove. This follows common sense organization - pots are cooking implements that belong on stoves. Given that the game rewards points for putting items in their correct locations, this seems like a reasonable action to try to improve the score.

Looking at the environment and available actions, I notice there's a dirty pot on the dining table and a dishwasher in the kitchen. Since dirty dishes typically go in the dishwasher, I should:

Next action: take dirty pot from dining table

Reasoning:
1. The dirty pot is clearly out of place on the dining table
2. Dirty dishes belong in the dishwasher
3. We need to take the dirty pot first before we can put it in the dishwasher
4. This follows the pattern of putting things in their proper locations to improve the score, similar to how putting the milk in the fridge was correct in the action history

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a dirty pot in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there's a dishwasher which would be the proper place to clean dirty dishes
3. From previous actions, I've learned that putting things in their proper locations increases the score
4. The dishwasher is currently empty and would be the logical place for a dirty pot

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert dirty pot into dishwasher

This makes the most sense because:
- The pot is dirty and needs cleaning
- Dishwashers are designed to clean dirty dishes
- It follows the game's logic of putting items where they naturally belong
- Similar to how the milk went in the fridge, dirty dishes should go in the dishwasher

Looking at the environment and available actions, I notice there's a wet azure skirt on the dining chair. Based on the previous example where wet clothes were put in the clothes drier, I should take the wet azure skirt to eventually put it in the clothes drier.

Next action: take wet azure skirt from dining chair

Reasoning:
1. Wet clothes belong in the clothes drier (as shown in the example with the wet azure dress)
2. The skirt is currently in the kitchen, which is not its proper location
3. To move it to the clothes drier, I first need to take it
4. This will be the first step in a sequence to improve the score by putting the wet skirt in its proper location

Looking at the inventory, I have a wet azure skirt. Since it's wet, it needs to be dried. From previous experience in the example walkthrough, wet clothes should go in the clothes drier or on a clothesline. Neither of those are in the current room (kitchen), but I saw there was a sliding patio door leading east, which might lead back to where those drying facilities are.

Therefore, I should choose:
Next action: go east

This will let me move to the next room where I can properly place the wet azure skirt in a drying location.

Looking at the inventory, I have a wet azure skirt. Since it's wet, it should be hung to dry, similar to how the wet white jumper was correctly placed on the clothesline earlier (which increased the score).

Therefore, I should:
put wet azure skirt on clothesline

This is likely to be the correct location since:
1. It's wet clothing, which typically needs to be dried
2. The clothesline is designed for drying clothes
3. There's already another wet item (white jumper) correctly placed there
4. Previous successful score increases came from putting items in their logical locations

Next action: put wet azure skirt on clothesline

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, I see a wooden spoon on the BBQ
2. BBQ is not typically where you store kitchen utensils
3. The wooden spoon would belong in the kitchen
4. From previous actions, I know there's a kitchen to the west
5. Taking the wooden spoon would allow me to move it to its proper location

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take wooden spoon from BBQ

This is the best next action because:
- The wooden spoon is clearly out of place on the BBQ
- Kitchen utensils belong in the kitchen
- Moving it to its proper location will likely increase the score
- We need to take it first before we can move it to the correct location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a wooden spoon in my inventory that needs to be placed somewhere proper
2. Looking at the environment, there are several possible locations: BBQ, clothesline, patio chair, patio table, and workbench
3. From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can see that:
   - Wet clothes go on clothesline
   - Kitchen items typically belong in the kitchen
4. A wooden spoon is a kitchen utensil, so it probably belongs in the kitchen
5. I should go back to the kitchen to find its proper place

Therefore, the most logical action is:

Next action: go west

This will take me back to the kitchen where I can find a more appropriate place for the wooden spoon.

Let me think about this step by step:

2. Looking at the environment, there's a cutlery drawer which would be a logical place for a spoon
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that items need to go in their proper locations to get points
4. A spoon belongs with other cutlery, so the cutlery drawer would be the most appropriate location

Therefore, I should:

Next action: insert wooden spoon into cutlery drawer

This makes the most sense because:
- A spoon is a piece of cutlery
- The cutlery drawer is the proper storage location for cutlery
- This should improve the score as it's putting an item in its logical location

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that might need to be moved:
- clean pot on stove
- dirty cake slice on counter
- dirty pot in dishwasher
- milk in fridge
- wooden spoon in cutlery drawer

2. From previous actions, I know:
- The clean pot was already tried in different locations and wasn't correct
- The milk and wooden spoon are already in their correct locations (got points)
- The dirty pot is in the dishwasher which was correct (got points)

3. The only item that hasn't been dealt with yet is the dirty cake slice on the counter.

4. Since it's a dirty item, it likely belongs in either:
- the dishwasher (for cleaning)
- or the trash can (if it's waste)

Therefore, I should:

Next action: take dirty cake slice from counter

This is the logical next step because:
1. It's the only item we haven't tried to relocate yet
2. Being dirty, it needs to be moved to a proper disposal or cleaning location
3. We need to pick it up first before we can try putting it somewhere appropriate

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a dirty cake slice in my inventory
2. Looking at the available actions and considering this is a dirty item
3. From the example walkthrough, dirty items typically go in cleaning appliances (like washing machine for dirty clothes)
4. For dirty dishes/food items, the dishwasher would be the appropriate cleaning appliance
5. Looking at the available actions, I can "insert dirty cake slice into dishwasher"
6. This follows the pattern of putting things in their proper place to increase score

Next action: insert dirty cake slice into dishwasher

This is likely to be correct because:
- The item is dirty and needs cleaning
- The dishwasher is meant for cleaning dishes and food-related items
- Similar to how the example showed dirty pots going into the dishwasher
- Following the pattern of putting things in their proper place to get points

Looking at the environment and available actions, I notice the clean pot is still on the stove but earlier attempts showed this wasn't the right location. Since we need to put things in their proper places, I should:

Next action: take clean pot from stove

Reasoning:
1. The clean pot is currently on the stove, but previous attempts to place it there resulted in "Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else"
2. We need to find the proper location for the clean pot to improve our score
3. Taking it is the first step to being able to move it to its correct location
4. Based on the earlier feedback, it might belong in another room, so we need to pick it up first

Next action: <fill in>


Looking at the available actions and considering that we have a clean pot in our inventory, we should put it in its proper storage location. Since it's clean, it should go in the kitchen cupboard where other clean dishes and cookware are typically stored.

Next action: insert clean pot into kitchen cupboard

Reasoning:
1. The pot is clean, so it shouldn't go in the dishwasher or trash
2. Kitchen cupboards are the standard storage location for clean pots and pans
3. The fridge, oven, and countertop are not proper storage locations for pots
4. Previous attempts to put it on the stove were wrong, suggesting it needs to be stored away
5. The kitchen cupboard is currently empty and is a logical place for kitchen cookware
