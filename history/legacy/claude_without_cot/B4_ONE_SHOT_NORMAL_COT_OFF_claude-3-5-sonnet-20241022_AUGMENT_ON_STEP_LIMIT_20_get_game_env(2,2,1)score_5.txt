The chest of drawers contains a brown suit and a blue coat, so there's that. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a bed. The bed is large. But there isn't a thing on it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a clean white pullover in my inventory
2. There are two storage locations: wardrobe and chest of drawers
3. Generally, clean clothes should be stored in a wardrobe or dresser
4. Looking at the chest of drawers, it already contains formal wear (suit and coat)
5. The wardrobe is empty and is a proper storage place for casual wear like a pullover

Based on this analysis, I should put the clean white pullover in the wardrobe, as it's:
- A proper storage location for clean clothes
- Currently empty
- Makes logical sense for organizing clothes (casual wear in wardrobe)

Next action: insert clean white pullover into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1. Looking at the environment, we have clothing items in two storage furniture pieces: wardrobe and chest of drawers.
2. The clean white pullover is already in the wardrobe and gave us a point, so that's in the right place.
3. The brown suit and blue coat are in the chest of drawers.
4. Based on the previous example, proper clothing storage is important for scoring points.
5. The wardrobe seems to be the proper place for hanging clothes like coats and suits.
6. Therefore, we should move the blue coat and brown suit to the wardrobe.

Next action: take blue coat from chest of drawers

Reasoning: Since the wardrobe is likely the proper place for a coat (as it's typically used for hanging clothes), we should first take the blue coat to move it there.

Let me think about this step by step:

2. Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations: wardrobe, chest of drawers, and bed
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - The coat was originally in the chest of drawers, but since I took it out, it might need to go somewhere else
4. Since the blue coat appears to be a clean clothing item (it's not described as "dirty" or "wet"), it should probably go in the wardrobe with the other clean item (clean white pullover)

Next action: insert blue coat into wardrobe

This action should be correct because:
1. The wardrobe seems to be for storing clean clothes
2. In the example walkthrough, clean items were properly stored in their designated places
3. This action should increase the score if it's the correct location

   - A chest of drawers containing a brown suit
3. From the previous actions, we know:
   - The wardrobe seems to be a proper place for coats and pullovers (as we got points for putting them there)
   - The brown suit is in the chest of drawers, but we haven't tried moving it to the wardrobe
4. Since suits are formal clothing like coats, the wardrobe might be the proper place for the brown suit

Therefore, I think we should:

Next action: take brown suit from chest of drawers

This will allow us to then try putting it in the wardrobe to see if it's the proper location.

This should be the correct action because:

Looking at the current state, I notice that all the clothes (blue coat, brown suit, and clean white pullover) are already properly stored in the wardrobe, and we've already received points for putting them there. The chest of drawers is empty, and there's nothing on the bed that needs to be moved.

Since all items are already in their correct locations and we've maximized our score in this room, the most logical next action would be to:

Next action: go south

Reasoning:
1. All clothes are properly stored in the wardrobe
2. We've already received points for all possible proper placements in this room
3. To find more items to organize and increase our score further, we should explore other rooms
4. The only available exit is to the south

Looking at the previous actions and the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice that clean clothes belong in the wardrobe (as shown by the successful placement of the clean white pullover, blue coat, and brown suit).

I see several clean items in the room:
1. clean gray polo shirt
2. clean teal skirt
3. black coat
4. brown coat

Since we need to take items before we can put them in the wardrobe, and we can only do one action at a time, let's start by taking one of these items.

Next action: take clean gray polo shirt

Reasoning: I chose to take the clean gray polo shirt first because:
1. It's a clean item, which means it likely belongs in the wardrobe
2. It's directly on the floor, making it an easy first pick
3. Following the pattern from previous successful actions, we'll need to take it before we can put it in its proper location (the wardrobe)

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.

Looking at the pattern from the example walkthrough and previous actions, clean clothes should go into the wardrobe. Since I'm currently carrying a clean gray polo shirt, I should head back north where the wardrobe is located.

Next action: go north

Reasoning:
1. The clean gray polo shirt is a clean clothing item
2. From previous successful actions, clean clothes (like the white pullover, blue coat, and brown suit) were placed in the wardrobe
3. The wardrobe is in the room to the north
4. Therefore, going north is the logical next step to reach the wardrobe where I can properly store the clean polo shirt

Next action: insert clean gray polo shirt into wardrobe

Reasoning:
1. The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clean clothes, as evidenced by the previous successful actions with the white pullover, blue coat, and brown suit that increased the score
2. The gray polo shirt is specifically described as "clean"
3. Putting clean clothes in the wardrobe has consistently given points in previous actions
4. Other options like the chest of drawers or bed don't seem to be proper storage locations for clothes based on the game's scoring system

Looking at the current state, all the clothing items (clean white pullover, blue coat, brown suit, clean gray polo shirt) are already properly placed in the wardrobe, and we've gotten points for each of them. Since everything in this room is already in its proper place and there's nothing else to organize, the best action would be to:

Next action: close wardrobe

Reasoning: Since we've finished putting all clothes in the wardrobe, it makes sense to close it properly. This might give us an additional point for proper organization, and it's a logical action to take after we're done using a storage furniture piece.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve my score
2. Looking at the current environment:
   - The wardrobe is closed
   - The chest of drawers is open but empty
   - The bed is empty
   - I have nothing in my inventory

3. From the example walkthrough and action history, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is currently closed
   - I might need to check if there are more clothes to store

4. Therefore, I should first check if there are any more clothes in the wardrobe that need to be organized.

Next action: open wardrobe

This is the best next action because:
- I need to check if there are any more clothes in the wardrobe that need to be moved
- The wardrobe is where clean clothes belong
- I can't see what's in the wardrobe while it's closed

Since all the clean clothes are already properly stored in the wardrobe (as evidenced by the score increases we got for putting them there), and there's nothing else in the environment that needs to be moved, there's no immediate action that would improve our score.

The wardrobe is already open, the clothes are all in their correct place, and the chest of drawers is empty. The bed doesn't have anything on it that needs to be moved.

In this case, we should explore other areas of the house to find more items that might need proper placement.

Looking at the previous actions and the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice that coats and clean clothes belong in the wardrobe which is in the bedroom. Since there's a black coat on the sofa, I should take it and then move it to the wardrobe.

Next action: take black coat from sofa

Reasoning:
1. We know from previous actions that coats belong in the wardrobe (like the blue coat we put there earlier)
2. The black coat is currently on the sofa, which is not its proper location
3. To move it to the wardrobe, we first need to take it
4. After taking it, we can go north to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe in the next actions

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a black coat in my inventory
2. I see a bookcase, armchair, coffee table, and sofa as potential storage locations
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes generally go in specific storage furniture
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - The bookcase was just revealed as a secret storage location

4. Since the black coat is a piece of clothing and we found a secret bookcase, it seems logical that the bookcase might be meant for storing coats.

Therefore, I should try:

Next action: insert black coat into bookcase

This seems like the most logical choice because:
1. It's a storage location that was specifically revealed through a secret button
2. The game often rewards putting items in their proper designated locations
3. The bookcase being empty was specifically mentioned, suggesting it needs to be filled

Let me think about this step by step:

1. From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes go in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (north)

2. Looking at the current environment:
   - There's a black coat in the bookcase (which was wrong position)
   - There's a brown coat and clean teal skirt on the armchair
   - The bedroom is to the north

3. Since the black coat was put in the wrong position (bookcase), I should:
   - Take it from the bookcase first
   - Then later move it to the wardrobe

Next action: take black coat from bookcase

Reasoning: This is the first step to correct the wrong placement of the black coat. After taking it, we can go north to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe where it belongs.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. I have a black coat in my inventory that I previously tried to put in the bookcase, but that was wrong
2. I know from the previous actions that clothes generally belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom
3. The bedroom is north of the current room
4. There are also other clothes (brown coat and clean teal skirt) on the armchair that will likely need to go to the wardrobe too
5. To get the black coat to the wardrobe, I first need to go north to the bedroom

Therefore, the most logical next action is:

Next action: go north

This will get me to the bedroom where I can put the black coat in its proper location (the wardrobe), which should increase my score. After that, I can come back for the other clothes.

Looking at the pattern from both the example walkthrough and action history, clean clothes and coats belong in the wardrobe. Since I'm holding a black coat and the wardrobe is already open, I should put it there.

Next action: insert black coat into wardrobe

Reasoning:
1. The wardrobe is where other coats and clean clothes are stored (blue coat, brown suit, clean polo shirt, clean pullover are all there)
2. Previous successful actions that gave points involved putting similar items in the wardrobe
3. When I tried putting the black coat in the bookcase earlier, it was wrong
4. The wardrobe is already open, making this the logical next step
5. This action will likely increase the score as it puts the item in its proper location

Looking at the current state, all the clothing items in the wardrobe (black coat, clean gray polo shirt, brown suit, blue coat, and clean white pullover) are already in their correct positions as indicated by the previous score increases. The chest of drawers is empty, and there's nothing else to interact with that would improve the score.

Since all items are in their proper places, the most logical action would be to:

Reasoning: Since we've finished putting all the clothes in their proper place in the wardrobe, it makes sense to close it to maintain organization. This is similar to how we would act in real life after finishing putting away clothes.

Let me think about this...

Since my goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve the score, I should first check if there are any items I can work with. Looking at the environment, the wardrobe seems to be closed and might contain items that need to be organized.

The wardrobe is a storage location for clothes (as we saw from previous actions where we put coats, suits, and shirts in it), so I should:

Next action: open wardrobe

This will let me see if there are any items inside that might need to be moved to their proper locations, or if there's space for any new items we might find.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Choose 'one' action from above list.
Next action: <fill in>


Looking at the previous actions and the goal of putting things in their proper locations, I notice that clean clothes and coats belong in the wardrobe in the bedroom. Since there's a brown coat on the armchair, we should:

Next action: take brown coat from armchair

Reasoning:
1. From previous actions, we know that coats (black coat, blue coat) were placed in the wardrobe in the bedroom
2. The brown coat is likely meant to go in the wardrobe as well
3. To move it to the wardrobe, we first need to take it
4. After taking it, we can then go north to the bedroom and put it in the wardrobe in the next actions
