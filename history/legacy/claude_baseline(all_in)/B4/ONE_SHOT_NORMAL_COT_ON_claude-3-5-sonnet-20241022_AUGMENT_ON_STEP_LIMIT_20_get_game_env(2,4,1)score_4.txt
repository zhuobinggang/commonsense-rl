The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A pair of blue moccasins in our inventory
   - Brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Clean azure skirt on the dressing table
   - Clean plaid pullover on the nightstand

2) From the example walkthrough, we learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Caps go on hat rack
   - Clean clothes might go in wardrobe or chest of drawers

3) Since we have a pair of blue moccasins in our inventory, and there's a wardrobe and chest of drawers:
   - Shoes typically belong in a wardrobe or chest of drawers for storage
   - Both storage options are currently empty

4) Let's try putting the blue moccasins in the wardrobe first, as it's a common place to store shoes.

Consideration: The wardrobe is empty and is a proper storage location for shoes. Let's try storing the blue moccasins there.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes go in closets/wardrobes
   - Shoes like moccasins typically go on shoe racks/cabinets
   - The blue moccasins are currently in the wrong place

2) Looking at the current environment:
   - We're in a bedroom
   - There's a blue moccasins in the wardrobe that was placed incorrectly
   - We need to move it somewhere else, likely to a shoe rack in another room

3) From the previous action feedback:
   - The blue moccasins are in the wrong position
   - We're told to put it somewhere else, maybe in the other room

4) Therefore:
   - First step should be to take the blue moccasins from the wardrobe
   - Then we can explore other rooms to find the proper place for them

Consideration: We need to first get the blue moccasins out of the wardrobe since we know it's in the wrong place. We can't move it to its proper location until we have it in our inventory.

Next action: take blue moccasins from wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Dirty clothes go to washing machine
   - Wet clothes go to clothes drier
   - Caps/hats go to hat rack
   - Shoes/moccasins might go to shoe cabinet (since there was one mentioned in corridor)

2. I currently have blue moccasins in my inventory, and I tried putting them in the wardrobe but got feedback that it was the wrong position and should go "somewhere else, maybe the other room"

3. Since there was a shoe cabinet mentioned in the corridor in the example walkthrough, that's likely where shoes should go

4. To reach the shoe cabinet, I need to first go south to the corridor

Therefore, the most logical next action is to go south to reach the corridor where I can likely find the shoe cabinet.

Next action: go south

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have blue moccasins in my inventory, which are shoes
2. Looking at the environment, there's a shoe cabinet which is the most logical place for shoes
3. From the example walkthrough, I can see that items need to be put in their proper locations to get points
4. The shoe cabinet is specifically designed for storing shoes
5. Other options like hat rack, key holder, and umbrella stand are not appropriate for shoes
6. The previous attempt to put them in the wardrobe was wrong, suggesting they belong somewhere else

Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

This is the most logical choice because:
- Shoes belong in a shoe cabinet
- It's a proper storage location for footwear
- The example walkthrough shows that putting items in their correct locations increases the score
- The shoe cabinet is currently empty and available

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items:
   - blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)
   - clean white skirt on coat hanger
   - clean white socks on floor

2. From the example walkthrough, we can learn:
   - Clothes like skirts should probably be in a wardrobe
   - Socks likely belong in a specific place too
   - We already correctly placed the moccasins in the shoe cabinet

3. To improve score, we need to:
   - Move items to their proper locations
   - First we need to collect the movable items
   - Then we can explore other rooms to find proper storage locations

4. Best next step:
   - Since the white skirt is clean and on a coat hanger, we should take it to find its proper storage location
   - The socks will need to be moved too, but let's handle one item at a time

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. I see clean white socks on the floor
3. From the example walkthrough:
   - Clean clothes typically go on hangers/racks
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet (which I already did with the moccasins)
4. Since the white skirt is clean, it should go on the coat hanger
5. The socks can be dealt with after placing the skirt

Next action: put clean white skirt on coat hanger

Reasoning:
- This follows the pattern from the example where items are put in their logical places
- Clean clothes belong on hangers/racks, not in shoe cabinets or umbrella stands
- The coat hanger is currently empty and is the most appropriate place for a clean skirt
- This action is likely to increase the score since it's putting an item in its proper location

Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a pair of blue moccasins, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. From the example walkthrough, I see that:
   - Clean clothes go in the wardrobe (in the other room)
   - Dirty clothes go in the washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in the dryer
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on the hat rack

2. Looking at the current environment:
   - The blue moccasins are already in the shoe cabinet (correct position)
   - The clean white skirt is on the coat hanger
   - There are clean white socks on the floor

3. Since the clean white skirt was put back on the coat hanger and the game said "Wrong position", we should take it and move it to the wardrobe in the other room.

4. Similarly, the clean white socks should probably go in the wardrobe since they're clean.

5. We should handle one item at a time.

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

Reasoning: Since we know the clean white skirt is in the wrong position and needs to go to the wardrobe, we should take it first. Then we can move north to the other room and put it in the wardrobe.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clothes go in wardrobes/closets
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinets
   - Hats go on hat racks
3. Since this is a clean white skirt, it should probably go in a wardrobe/closet
4. However, I'm in the corridor and there's no wardrobe here
5. I notice there's an exit to the north, which might lead to a room with a wardrobe
6. I should go north to find the proper place for the clean white skirt

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since I can't see a wardrobe in the current room and clean clothes should be stored in wardrobes (based on logical organization), I should explore the north room to find the proper storage location for the clean white skirt. This is the most logical next step to improve my score.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory that needs to be stored properly
2. Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers
3. From previous actions, I know putting things in their right place increases the score
4. Looking at the environment, there are two potential storage options:
   - Wardrobe
   - Chest of drawers
5. Since it's a clean piece of clothing, it should go in one of these storage furniture
6. The wardrobe was already tried earlier with other items and was wrong
7. Therefore, the chest of drawers might be the correct location for clean clothes

Next action: insert clean white skirt into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical choice because:
- The item is clean (should be stored properly)
- Chest of drawers is a proper storage place for clothes
- We haven't tried this location yet
- The wardrobe was already proven to be wrong for other items

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - Shoes typically go in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer

2) Looking at the items in the current room:
   - brown moccasins (shoes) -> should go in shoe cabinet in corridor
   - clean azure skirt -> should go in wardrobe
   - clean plaid pullover -> should go in wardrobe
   - clean white skirt -> should go in wardrobe

3) From our action history:
   - We learned that blue moccasins belonged in shoe cabinet
   - We tried putting clean white skirt in chest of drawers but it was wrong

4) Next logical step:
   - Since we know shoes go in the shoe cabinet (from previous success with blue moccasins)
   - The brown moccasins should be moved to the corridor's shoe cabinet first
   - We need to take them before moving to corridor

Therefore:

Consideration: We should take the brown moccasins first so we can move them to the shoe cabinet in the corridor, similar to what worked with the blue moccasins earlier.

Next action: take brown moccasins from nightstand

2) From the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough:
   - Shoes (blue moccasins) were put in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
   - Clean clothes were put in proper storage furniture
3) Since I have brown moccasins (shoes), and we know from previous experience that shoes belong in the shoe cabinet:
   - The shoe cabinet is in the corridor
   - I need to go to the corridor to put these moccasins in their proper place

4) Therefore, I should first go to the corridor (south) before trying to put the moccasins away.

Consideration: Since I need to get to the corridor to access the shoe cabinet, and I'm currently in the bedroom, I should first move south.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm carrying brown moccasins and need to put them somewhere proper
2. Earlier, I successfully put blue moccasins in the shoe cabinet and got a point
3. Since both are moccasins (shoes), they likely belong in the same place
4. The shoe cabinet is the logical place for shoes
5. There's also a clean white socks on the floor that will need to be dealt with after
6. Based on the example walkthrough, proper placement increases the score

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

Reasoning:
- This follows the same pattern as the blue moccasins which gave a point
- The shoe cabinet is specifically designed for shoes
- This will free up my inventory to handle the socks next
- Other options like putting them on hat rack or coat hanger wouldn't make logical sense for shoes

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have clean white socks on the floor that needs to be put somewhere proper.
2. From previous actions, we know:
   - Shoes go in the shoe cabinet (as proven by blue and brown moccasins)
   - Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers
3. Since we're in the corridor and there's an exit to the north (bedroom), and socks are clean clothing items, they probably belong in the bedroom storage.
4. First step would be to pick up the socks before moving to the bedroom.

Next action: take clean white socks

Reasoning:
- This is the logical first step before we can move the socks to their proper location
- We need to have the item in our inventory before we can place it somewhere else
- The socks are currently on the floor, which is definitely not their proper location

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm carrying clean white socks
2. From the example walkthrough, I learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on hat rack
3. Clean socks are clothing items that should be stored properly
4. Looking at the available locations:
   - Shoe cabinet is for shoes (already has moccasins)
   - Hat rack is for hats
   - Coat hanger is for coats/outerwear
   - Key holder is for keys
   - Umbrella stand is for umbrellas
5. None of these locations seem appropriate for socks
6. There's an exit to the north (bedroom) which might have more appropriate storage
7. In previous actions, we saw a chest of drawers in the bedroom

Next action: go north

Reasoning: Since none of the storage options in the corridor are appropriate for clean socks, and we know there's a bedroom to the north that might have more suitable storage (like the chest of drawers we saw earlier), the best action is to go north to explore better storage options for the socks.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

   - Clean clothes typically go into chest of drawers
   - Dirty clothes go into washing machine
   - Shoes go into shoe cabinet
   - Wet clothes go into clothes drier

3) Since the white socks are clean, they should go into the chest of drawers, similar to how other clean items are stored

4) Looking at the available actions, "insert clean white socks into chest of drawers" seems most appropriate

Consideration: Clean clothes belong in the chest of drawers, and I'm carrying clean white socks. This would be the proper storage location to improve my score.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have several clean clothing items:
   - clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
   - clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)
   - clean white skirt (in chest of drawers)
   - clean white socks (in chest of drawers)

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean socks belong in the chest of drawers (and they're already there)
   - The clean white skirt was previously put in chest of drawers but was wrong

3) From previous actions in action history:
   - Clean white socks were correctly placed in chest of drawers
   - Clean white skirt was wrong in chest of drawers
   - Shoes belong in shoe cabinet in corridor

4) This suggests that:
   - Clean socks belong in chest of drawers
   - Clean clothes might need to be stored in wardrobe

5) Since the clean white skirt is in the wrong place (chest of drawers), we should move it first.

Consideration: The clean white skirt needs to be moved from the chest of drawers since we know it's in the wrong place. We should take it and try putting it somewhere else, likely the wardrobe.

Next action: take clean white skirt from chest of drawers

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. From the example walkthrough, I see that clean clothes typically go into the chest of drawers (like the clean white socks)
3. I tried putting the skirt in the wardrobe earlier (Action 0) and it was wrong
4. I tried putting it on the coat hanger (Action 5) and it was wrong
5. Since it's a clean item like the white socks that went into the chest of drawers successfully, that's likely where it belongs
6. Looking at the current environment, there's already clean white socks in the chest of drawers, suggesting this is where clean clothes should go

Next action: insert clean white skirt into chest of drawers

This seems like the most logical action because:
1. It's a clean item like the socks that went successfully into the chest of drawers
2. We've already tried other locations and they were wrong
3. The chest of drawers seems to be the storage place for clean clothes in this game

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have several clean clothing items:
   - clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
   - clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)
   - clean white skirt (in chest of drawers)
   - clean white socks (in chest of drawers)

2) From the example walkthrough and previous actions:
   - Clean socks belong in chest of drawers (we got a point for this)
   - The clean white skirt was rejected from chest of drawers
   - Clean clothes seem to belong in specific storage furniture

3) The clean white skirt has been tried in:
   - coat hanger (wrong)
   - chest of drawers (wrong)
   This suggests it might belong in the wardrobe

4) Since we need to move the clean white skirt somewhere else, and we haven't tried the wardrobe yet, we should first take it.

Consideration: The clean white skirt has been placed incorrectly multiple times, and we need to try putting it somewhere new. Let's first take it from the chest of drawers.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean white skirt that needs to be put somewhere proper.

2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Clean clothes go in chest of drawers
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on hat rack

3) Since the white skirt is clean, based on the pattern where we successfully put clean white socks in the chest of drawers, clean clothes should go in the chest of drawers.

4) We tried putting the clean white skirt in the chest of drawers before (Action 16) but got the message "Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room."

5) This suggests that while clean clothes generally go in the chest of drawers, this particular skirt belongs somewhere else, possibly in the wardrobe since we haven't tried that yet.

Consideration: Since we've tried the chest of drawers and got a hint to try somewhere else, and the wardrobe is another storage furniture piece in the room that we haven't tried yet for the skirt, let's try putting it there.

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several clean clothing items:
   - clean azure skirt on dressing table
   - clean plaid pullover on nightstand
   - clean white skirt in wardrobe
   - clean white socks in chest of drawers

2. From previous actions, we learned:
   - clean white socks belong in chest of drawers (already there, +1 score)
   - clean white skirt belongs in wardrobe (already there, +1 score)
   - shoes belong in shoe cabinet in corridor

3. Since clean clothes seem to belong in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers, we should try moving the remaining clean items to one of these locations.

4. The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table, which is likely not its proper location since it's clean clothing.

Next action: take clean azure skirt from dressing table

Reasoning: We should start by picking up the clean azure skirt since it's currently in what's likely the wrong location (dressing table). After picking it up, we can try putting it in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers to see which is the correct location.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm holding a clean azure skirt and need to put it somewhere proper

2) Looking at previous successful actions:
- Clean white socks went into chest of drawers (score up)
- Clean white skirt went into wardrobe (score up)
- Shoes went into shoe cabinet in corridor

3) Since this is a clean clothing item like the white skirt that scored points in the wardrobe, it's likely that clean skirts belong in the wardrobe

4) The wardrobe seems to be for storing clean clothes that you wear (like skirts), while the chest of drawers is for smaller items like socks

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe
