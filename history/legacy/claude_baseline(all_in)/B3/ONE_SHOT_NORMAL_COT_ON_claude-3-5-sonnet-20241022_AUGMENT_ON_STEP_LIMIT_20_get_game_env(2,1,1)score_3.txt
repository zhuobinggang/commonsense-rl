Inventory: You are carrying:  a clean plaid polo shirt
Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe is empty, what a horrible day! As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean plaid polo shirt, which is a piece of clothing
2) Clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or drawers
3) Looking at the environment, there are two main storage options:
   - A wardrobe
   - A chest of drawers
4) The wardrobe is described as "large" and is currently empty
5) Wardrobes are specifically designed for hanging and storing clothes
6) In previous examples, putting items in their proper locations increased the score

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is the most appropriate place for storing clothes and it's currently empty, inserting the clean plaid polo shirt into the wardrobe would be the most logical action to improve the score.

Next action: insert clean plaid polo shirt into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2. Looking at the environment, I see:
   - A clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage for clean clothes
3. From the previous action (Action 0), I already put the clean plaid polo shirt INTO the wardrobe and got a point
4. Since the shirt is already in its correct location (wardrobe), I don't need to move it
5. Looking at other items in the room, they are all empty furniture
6. The only direction available is east, which might lead to new items to organize

Next action: go east

Reasoning: Since I've already properly placed the clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe (which was correct and gave a point), and there are no other items to organize in this room, the best action is to explore the next room by going east to find more items to organize.

You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors?

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several clothing items:
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - clean white polo shirt on floor
   - gray coat on armchair

2) From the previous successful action, I know:
   - clean clothes go in the wardrobe
   - the wardrobe is likely in another room

3) From the room description:
   - I can go west
   - I previously came from west direction

4) Strategy:
   - I should collect all clean clothes
   - Take them to the wardrobe to increase score
   - Since I can carry multiple items, I should start picking them up

5) Looking at the items:
   - All clothing items appear to be clean
   - Best to start picking them up systematically

Consideration: Since I need to collect clean clothes to put them in the wardrobe, and I can see a clean white polo shirt on the floor, I should start by picking that up. It's also good practice to pick up items from the floor first.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - The first action showed putting a clean plaid polo shirt into wardrobe was correct

2) Currently I have:
   - A clean white polo shirt in my inventory
   - I'm in the livingroom
   - The wardrobe was in another room

3) Since I'm carrying a clean polo shirt and we know clean clothes belong in the wardrobe:
   - I need to get back to the room with the wardrobe
   - The description mentions I can go west
   - The previous action history shows I came from west

4) Therefore, the logical next step is to:
   - Go back west first to get to the room with the wardrobe

Consideration: I need to return to the room with the wardrobe to properly store the clean white polo shirt, since clean clothes belong in wardrobes.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we're in a bedroom with various furniture including a wardrobe that contains two clean polo shirts.

2) From the action history, we've already successfully:
   - Put a clean plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe (scored a point)
   - Put a clean white polo shirt in the wardrobe (scored a point)

3) Since both clean polo shirts are already in their proper location (the wardrobe) and we got points for putting them there, we shouldn't move them.

4) Looking at the available actions, there's nothing else that needs to be organized or moved to a different location.

5) The wardrobe is currently open, and generally it's good practice to close storage furniture when you're done using it.

Consideration: Since we've completed organizing the items and the wardrobe is still open, we should close it to properly finish our task.

Next action: close wardrobe

You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score.

2) Looking at the environment:
- There are several furniture pieces but most are empty
- The wardrobe is closed and we previously put clean clothes in it
- We've already scored points by putting clean polo shirts in the wardrobe

3) Analyzing the situation:
- The wardrobe seems to be a key location for storing clothes
- It's currently closed
- There might be more opportunities to interact with it
- We should check if there are any more clothes we could store

4) Previous successful actions involved:
- Putting clean clothes in the wardrobe
- The wardrobe is a correct location for clean clothes

5) Next logical step:
- Since the wardrobe is closed and it's a key storage location
- We should open it to see if there are more opportunities
- Opening it will allow us to potentially put more items in it if we find any

Consideration: Opening the wardrobe is the most logical next step as it's been established as a correct storage location for clothes, and we need to be able to access it if we find more clean clothes to store.

Next action: open wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2) Looking at the current environment and inventory:
   - We're in a bedroom
   - There are two clean polo shirts in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be the correct place for clean clothes (as proven by previous actions that gave points)
   - Both shirts are already in the wardrobe, which is their proper location

3) Considering the previous actions:
   - We've already put both clean polo shirts in the wardrobe
   - We got points for these actions
   - The wardrobe is currently open

4) Best practices in text adventures:
   - When you're done with a container, it's usually good to close it
   - We've finished using the wardrobe for now
   - The wardrobe is currently open (from Action 6 in history)

Consideration: Since we've finished putting the clean clothes in the wardrobe and don't need to access it anymore, we should close it to maintain order.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2. Looking at the current environment, there are several storage furniture pieces: wardrobe, chest of drawers, desk, dressing table, nightstand
3. From action history, I know:
   - The wardrobe is currently closed
   - The wardrobe contains clean clothes (white polo shirt and plaid polo shirt)
   - These clothes are already properly placed (got points for them)
4. I should check other storage furniture to see if there are any items to organize
5. The chest of drawers is mentioned but I don't know what's inside yet
6. Most other furniture pieces are described as empty
7. Opening/examining containers is a good first step to find items that need organizing

Next action: examine chest of drawers

Reasoning:
- The chest of drawers is one of the main storage furniture pieces we haven't examined yet
- While the description says it's empty, we should verify by examining it
- This will help us understand if there are any items we need to organize
- It's better to systematically check containers before moving to another room

   - I've already put clean clothes in the wardrobe successfully
   - The wardrobe seems to be a proper place for clean clothes
   - I've been opening/closing the wardrobe

5) Considering next steps:
   - Since I don't have any items to put away
   - And I've already explored the wardrobe
   - I should explore other furniture that might contain items or need items

6) The chest of drawers is currently open but empty
   - It's good practice to close storage furniture when not in use
   - This might be required for proper organization

Consideration: Since the chest of drawers is open and empty, and we've finished using it, we should close it to maintain proper organization.

   - The wardrobe and chest of drawers can be opened/closed

4) To find more items to organize, I should:
   - Check what's inside the storage furniture
   - The chest of drawers hasn't been examined inside yet

5) Since both wardrobe and chest of drawers are closed, and we've already dealt with the wardrobe's contents, we should check the chest of drawers next.

1) Looking at the environment, we have several furniture pieces: wardrobe, chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, desk, and dressing table.

2) From the action history, we've already:
   - Put clean clothes (plaid polo shirt and white polo shirt) in the wardrobe
   - Opened and closed the wardrobe and chest of drawers multiple times

3) The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score.

4) Currently:
   - The wardrobe is closed and contains clean clothes (which is correct)
   - The chest of drawers is open but empty
   - All other furniture pieces are empty

5) Since we've already handled the clean clothes in the wardrobe correctly (as shown by the score increases), and there are no other items in our inventory or visible in the room to put away, we should explore other areas to find more items.

6) The description mentions we can go east, and we've been there before to get the clean white polo shirt.

Consideration: Since there's nothing left to organize in this room, and we need to find more items to improve our score, we should explore other areas.

Next action: go east



Task: You are a experienced text game player, your goal is put things in there proper locations and improve your score.

You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items:
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - brown suit on end table
   - dictionary on coffee table

2) Based on previous successful actions and typical game logic:
   - Clean clothes usually belong in a wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
   - We've already successfully put clean polo shirts in the wardrobe

3) Since we want to improve our score by putting things in their proper locations:
   - The clean checkered jumper, being a clean clothing item, should go in the wardrobe
   - We need to take it first before we can move it

4) Order of operations:
   - First take the clean checkered jumper
   - Then go west to bedroom
   - Then put it in wardrobe

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper is a clothing item that should go in the wardrobe, similar to how we successfully stored other clean clothes there. We should take it first.

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from sofa

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have a clean checkered jumper
2) From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can see:
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom
   - The bedroom is west of the livingroom

3) Since I have a clean jumper and I know clean clothes belong in the wardrobe, I should:
   - First go to the bedroom (west)
   - Then put the jumper in the wardrobe

4) Looking at the available actions, I can see "go west" is an option

5) This aligns with my goal since:
   - It moves me closer to the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is the proper location for clean clothes
   - Putting clothes in their proper location improves the score

Therefore:

Consideration: I need to get to the bedroom to access the wardrobe, which is where clean clothes belong.
Next action: go west

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean checkered jumper that needs to be stored properly

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage options:
   - A wardrobe (currently closed)
   - A chest of drawers (currently open)
   - Various surfaces (bed, desk, chair, etc.)

3) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in storage furniture (like wardrobes)
   - The wardrobe was used earlier for storing clean polo shirts

4) Based on previous successful actions:
   - Clean clothes belong in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is currently closed

5) Therefore, to properly store the clean checkered jumper:
   - First I need to open the wardrobe
   - Then I can put the jumper inside

Consideration: Since the wardrobe is closed and it's the proper storage location for clean clothes, I should open it first before placing the jumper inside.

2. The clean checkered jumper is currently in the chest of drawers and needs to be moved.
3. The wardrobe seems to be the right place for clean clothes in this room (as evidenced by the successful placement of clean polo shirts earlier).
4. To move the clean checkered jumper to its correct location, we first need to take it from the chest of drawers.
5. We can then go to the other room (east) to find the proper location for it.

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from chest of drawers

This is the logical first step to fix the incorrect placement of the clean checkered jumper. After taking it, we can then explore the other room to find its proper location.

The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I have a clean checkered jumper in my inventory
2) Earlier when I tried to put it in the chest of drawers, the game said "Wrong position, you should put it somewhere else, maybe the other room"
3) Looking at the environment, there are several storage options:
   - Wardrobe (currently contains clean polo shirts)
   - Chest of drawers (empty)
   - Various surfaces (bed, desk, etc.)

4) Since the game specifically mentioned "maybe the other room", and the wardrobe already has clean clothes in it, this suggests the clean checkered jumper belongs in the wardrobe with the other clean clothes.

5) The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage for clean clothes, as evidenced by:
   - It already contains other clean clothes
   - Previous successful score increases came from putting clean clothes in the wardrobe

Consideration: The clean checkered jumper is a clean clothing item, and the wardrobe appears to be the designated storage for clean clothes in this room. Previous actions confirm that putting clean clothes in the wardrobe increases the score.

Next action: insert clean checkered jumper into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have clean clothes in the wardrobe
2. From previous actions, we know:
   - Clean clothes in wardrobe was correct (got points)
   - Putting clean checkered jumper in chest of drawers was wrong
3. The wardrobe currently contains:
   - clean checkered jumper
   - clean white polo shirt
   - clean plaid polo shirt
4. Since they're all clean clothes and we got points for putting them in the wardrobe before, they're in the right place
5. There's no dirty or wet clothes that need washing/drying
6. Since everything is already in its proper place (wardrobe), we don't need to move anything

Next action: go east
Reasoning: Since all clothes in this room are already in their correct location (wardrobe), we should explore other rooms to find more items that might need organizing.

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

   - gray coat on armchair
   - dictionary on coffee table

2. Based on previous experience in text games:
   - Clothes typically belong in wardrobes or closets
   - Books typically belong in bookcases
   - The bookcase is currently empty

3. Looking at the items:
   - The dictionary is a book, and there's an empty bookcase
   - This would be a logical pairing to improve score

4. Previous actions show:
   - We've been putting clothes in the wardrobe in the bedroom
   - We haven't used the bookcase yet

5. Most logical first step:
   - Take the dictionary and put it in the bookcase
   - Since we need to take something before we can put it somewhere, we should take the dictionary first

Next action: take dictionary from coffee table

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a dictionary
2. Looking at the available locations, a bookcase would be the most logical place for a dictionary
3. The bookcase is currently open and empty
4. From previous experience in text games, putting items in their logical locations usually increases the score
5. Other locations like wastepaper basket, TV stand, armchair, etc. don't make logical sense for a dictionary
6. There are also other items (brown suit and gray coat) that need to be dealt with, but let's handle the dictionary first

Next action: insert dictionary into bookcase

This action makes the most sense because:
- A dictionary belongs in a bookcase
- It's a logical pairing that's likely to increase the score
- The bookcase is already open and ready to receive items
- We should handle one item at a time, starting with what we're currently holding
