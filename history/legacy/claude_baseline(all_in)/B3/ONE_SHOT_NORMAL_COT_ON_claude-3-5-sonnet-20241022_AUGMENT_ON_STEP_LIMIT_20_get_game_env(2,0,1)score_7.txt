Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - wet white jumper (on patio chair)
   - clean pot (on workbench)
   - wooden spoon (on BBQ)
   - milk (in inventory)

2) Based on common sense and the game's scoring pattern:
   - Wet clothes typically belong on a clothesline to dry
   - Kitchen items like pots and spoons belong in the kitchen
   - Milk should be stored in a refrigerator (probably inside)

3) Most urgent actions:
   - The wet white jumper should go on the clothesline to dry
   - This is most logical as clotheslines are specifically for drying clothes
   - The clothesline is currently empty

4) Other items can wait for now, as we should handle one task at a time.

Consideration: The most logical first step is to take the wet white jumper and put it on the clothesline. Since we can only do one action at a time, we should start by taking the jumper.

Next action: take wet white jumper from patio chair

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a wet white jumper and some milk
2) Looking at the environment and items:
   - The clothesline is typically used for drying wet clothes
   - The BBQ, patio table, patio chair, and workbench aren't meant for wet clothes
   - The milk doesn't seem to belong in any of these outdoor locations

3) Based on the example walkthrough:
   - Wet clothes should be dried
   - The clothesline would be the proper place for wet clothes
   - This is similar to how the wet azure dress was put in the clothes drier

4) Therefore:
   - The wet white jumper should go on the clothesline to dry
   - This would likely increase the score as it's the proper location

Next action: put wet white jumper on clothesline

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have "some milk"
2) Looking at the environment, I see various furniture and items
3) Milk is typically stored in a refrigerator or kitchen, not in a backyard
4) The sliding patio door leads west, which likely leads inside the house
5) The proper location for milk would be inside the house, probably in a kitchen
6) None of the outdoor locations (BBQ, clothesline, patio chair, patio table, workbench) are appropriate for storing milk
7) Therefore, I should go inside to find a proper place for the milk

Consideration: Since milk needs to be stored properly and should be inside the house, I should go through the sliding patio door to enter the house.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, I see several items that need proper placement:
   - milk (in inventory)
   - dirty pot (on dining table)
   - dirty cake slice (on counter)
   - wet azure skirt (on dining chair)

2. Based on common sense and the game's patterns:
   - Milk belongs in the fridge to keep it fresh
   - Dirty dishes (pot) should go in the dishwasher
   - Wet clothes (azure skirt) should go in the clothes drier or on clothesline
   - Dirty dishes (cake slice) should go in the dishwasher

3. From previous examples in the walkthrough:
   - Putting items in their proper place increases the score
   - Wet clothes were put in the clothes drier
   - Dirty clothes went in the washing machine

4. The most straightforward action right now would be to put the milk in its proper place - the fridge.

Next action: insert milk into fridge

Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items that are out of place:
- dirty pot on dining table
- dirty cake slice on counter
- wet azure skirt on dining chair
- milk in fridge (already properly placed)

2) Based on common sense and typical object locations:
- Dirty dishes (pot and cake slice) should go in the dishwasher
- Wet clothes (azure skirt) should go in a clothes drier or on a clothesline
- Milk is already in the fridge (correct location)

3) Since we can only take one action, let's prioritize:
- The wet azure skirt is similar to the wet items in the example walkthrough that went to clothes drier
- The dirty dishes should go in dishwasher
- Both types of actions would improve score

4) Looking at previous successful actions in the walkthrough, putting wet clothes in proper drying locations earned points.

5) Therefore, let's start with the wet azure skirt since we know from the example that handling wet clothes earned points.

Next action: take wet azure skirt from dining chair

This will allow us to then move it to a proper drying location in subsequent turns.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a wet azure skirt
2) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Wet clothes go in the clothes drier or on clothesline
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Food items go in fridge

3) Since I have a wet azure skirt, I should try to find a clothes drier or clothesline
4) Looking at my current location (Kitchen), I don't see a clothes drier or clothesline
5) However, I notice there's a sliding patio door leading east
6) In the previous actions, we saw a clothesline being used in what seems to be a patio area
7) Therefore, I should go east to find the proper location for the wet skirt

Consideration: Since I need to get to the patio area where the clothesline is located, and there's a sliding patio door leading east, I should go east first.

Next action: go east

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a wet azure skirt
2) Looking at previous successful actions that increased the score:
   - Wet items (like wet white jumper) went on the clothesline
   - Dirty items went in washing machine
   - Clean items likely belong in specific places

3) Since the azure skirt is wet, and we previously got a point for putting the wet white jumper on the clothesline, the clothesline is likely the proper place for wet items to dry.

4) The clothesline is a logical place for wet clothes as this is how clothes are typically dried outdoors.

5) Other options like BBQ, patio chair, patio table, or workbench don't make logical sense for wet clothes.

Consideration: The wet azure skirt should be hung to dry, and based on the previous success with the wet white jumper, the clothesline is the proper location.

Next action: put wet azure skirt on clothesline

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items:
   - wooden spoon on BBQ
   - clean pot on workbench
   - wet clothes on clothesline

2) Considering proper locations:
   - The wet clothes (skirt and jumper) are already on the clothesline and scored points
   - Kitchen items (wooden spoon, clean pot) would belong in the kitchen
   - BBQ is outdoor furniture, but the wooden spoon isn't meant for BBQ

3) Based on previous games:
   - Kitchen utensils and cookware belong in the kitchen
   - The wooden spoon should be in the kitchen, not on a BBQ

4) Next logical step:
   - Take the wooden spoon to move it to the kitchen
   - The clean pot could also go to kitchen, but let's handle one item at a time

Consideration: The wooden spoon is currently in an improper location (BBQ). As a kitchen utensil, it should be moved to the kitchen. Taking it is the first step to relocating it properly.

Let me think about this step by step:

2) Since I took it from the BBQ, and the goal is to put things in their proper locations, the wooden spoon likely belongs in the kitchen
3) The kitchen is west through the sliding patio door
4) I also see a clean pot on the workbench - kitchenware also belongs in the kitchen
5) I should handle one item at a time
6) The wet clothes are already in their proper place on the clothesline (as confirmed by the score increase earlier)

Consideration: The wooden spoon was taken from the BBQ but as a kitchen utensil, it should be in the kitchen. I should go west to return to the kitchen.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a wooden spoon in my inventory that I took from the BBQ - it should go in the kitchen
2. Looking at the objects in the kitchen, the most logical place for a wooden spoon would be the cutlery drawer
3. There are also dirty items (dirty pot and dirty cake slice) that might need cleaning
4. The milk is already in the fridge which is correct
5. Since I have the wooden spoon, I should deal with that first
6. The cutlery drawer is the proper storage location for utensils like spoons

Next action: insert wooden spoon into cutlery drawer

This action makes the most sense because:
- Wooden spoons belong in kitchen drawers with other utensils
- The cutlery drawer is currently empty and available
- It's a logical storage location that would likely increase the score
- We should organize kitchen items before dealing with the dirty items

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several dirty items:
   - A dirty pot on the dining table
   - A dirty cake slice on the counter

2) From previous experience in text games, dirty items usually need to be cleaned in a dishwasher.

3) The dishwasher in the room is currently empty, which suggests it's ready to receive dirty items.

4) Between the dirty pot and dirty cake slice, the pot is a more typical item to put in a dishwasher.

5) Therefore, the logical first step would be to take the dirty pot from the dining table, so we can then put it in the dishwasher.

Consideration: Taking the dirty pot is the first step to properly placing it in the dishwasher, which should improve our score.

Next action: take dirty pot from dining table

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a dirty pot in my inventory
2. Looking at the environment, there's a dishwasher which is typically used for cleaning dirty dishes and pots
3. The dishwasher is currently empty
4. From the example walkthrough, we can see that putting items in their proper locations increases the score
5. Logically, a dirty pot should go into the dishwasher to be cleaned
6. Other options like putting it on tables, chairs, or in drawers wouldn't make sense for a dirty pot
7. Putting it in the trash would be wasteful
8. The fridge and oven aren't appropriate for storing dirty dishes

Next action: insert dirty pot into dishwasher

This action makes the most sense because:
- It follows the logical organization of a kitchen
- Dishwashers are specifically designed to clean dirty dishes and pots
- It's likely to increase the score as it's putting an item in its proper location
- It's similar to the example walkthrough where items were placed in their appropriate locations (like clothes in washing machine)

Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see a dirty cake slice on the counter. Since it's dirty, it should probably go in the dishwasher like the dirty pot did earlier.

2) The dishwasher is a cleaning appliance, and we got a point earlier for putting a dirty pot in there, so it's likely the right place for dirty dishes.

3) Looking at the available actions, taking the dirty cake slice would be the first step to putting it in its proper place.

4) This follows the pattern from previous successful actions where we:
   - First take an item
   - Then put it in its proper location
   - Get points for correct placements

Consideration: The dirty cake slice needs to be cleaned, and the dishwasher is the appropriate place for it. We need to take it first before we can move it.

Next action: take dirty cake slice from counter

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm holding a dirty cake slice
2) Looking at the name "dirty cake slice", it suggests it needs to be cleaned
3) In a kitchen, dirty dishes and utensils typically go in the dishwasher
4) There's already a dirty pot in the dishwasher, which was a correct move (got a point)
5) Following the same logic, the dirty cake slice should also go in the dishwasher
6) Looking at the available actions, "insert dirty cake slice into dishwasher" is an option

Consideration: Since the dirty cake slice is a dirty dish/utensil, and we got a point for putting the dirty pot in the dishwasher, it's logical to put the dirty cake slice in the dishwasher as well.

Next action: insert dirty cake slice into dishwasher

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment and available actions, I see several items that might need to be organized:
- dirty cake slice and dirty pot in dishwasher
- milk in fridge
- wooden spoon in cutlery drawer

2) Analyzing the current state:
- The dirty items are already in the dishwasher (right position)
- The milk is already in the fridge (right position)
- The wooden spoon is already in the cutlery drawer (right position)

3) Looking at what's left to organize:
- All items appear to be in their proper locations already
- The score has already been increased for these correct placements

4) Best practice in text games:
- When items are properly placed, it's good to close containers to keep things tidy
- Open containers might suggest we're not completely finished with the room

5) Considering the containers:
- The dishwasher is open and contains dirty dishes
- It would make sense to close it since we're done putting dirty dishes in it

Therefore, I think the most logical next action is to close the dishwasher since we've finished using it and all items inside are in their proper place.

Next action: close dishwasher

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment and available actions, I notice:
   - There's milk in the fridge (already in right place)
   - There's a wooden spoon in the cutlery drawer (already in right place)
   - The dishwasher is closed and contains dirty items
   - Most other containers are empty

2) From the action history:
   - We just put dirty items in the dishwasher
   - We closed the dishwasher

3) Analyzing potential moves:
   - Taking items that are already in their correct places (milk, wooden spoon) would be counterproductive
   - Opening/closing empty containers wouldn't help score
   - Moving east would take us to another room, but we've already organized this room

4) The dishwasher has dirty items in it and is closed:
   - In real life, after loading dirty dishes and closing the dishwasher, you would typically start it
   - However, there's no direct "start dishwasher" action available

5) Best next step:
   - Since most containers are in their proper state and items are in their correct places, we should explore other rooms for more items to organize
   - Going east would take us back to the backyard where we might find more items to organize

Next action: go east

Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. What's the point of an empty patio chair? You see a patio table. The patio table is stylish. The patio table appears to be empty. Hey, want to see a workbench? Look over there, a workbench. On the workbench you see a clean pot. Something scurries by right in the corner of your eye. Probably nothing.There is an open sliding patio door leading west.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several items:
   - wet azure skirt and wet white jumper on clothesline (already in right place)
   - clean pot on workbench

2) From previous experience:
   - Clean kitchenware usually belongs in kitchen cabinets/storage
   - The clean pot is currently on workbench, which isn't its proper place

3) Analyzing the items:
   - The wet clothes are already in their correct location (clothesline)
   - The clean pot should be moved to the kitchen for proper storage

4) Looking at possible actions:
   - Taking the clean pot would allow us to move it to its proper location
   - Other actions like examining or taking wet clothes wouldn't improve score

Consideration: The clean pot is out of place on a workbench. Since it's clean, it should be stored properly in the kitchen. First step would be to take the pot.

Next action: take clean pot from workbench



Task: You are a experienced text game player, your goal is put things in there proper locations and improve your score.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean pot and need to put it in its proper location
2) Looking at the environment, I have several options to place the pot
3) Since it's a clean pot, it should go in a kitchen cabinet or storage area
4) The kitchen is west of here through the sliding patio door
5) The workbench, BBQ, clothesline, patio chair, and patio table don't seem like proper places for storing clean cookware
6) Therefore, I should head to the kitchen to find a proper storage location

Consideration: The clean pot belongs in the kitchen where cooking items are stored. None of the locations in the backyard are appropriate for storing clean cookware. I should go west to the kitchen.

Next action: go west

Inventory: You are carrying:  a clean pot
Current enviroment: -= Kitchen =-You find yourself in a kitchen. A normal kind of place. The room is well lit.You can see a fridge. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains some milk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a kitchen cupboard. The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer contains a wooden spoon. Now that's what I call TextWorld! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a dishwasher. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. You can see an opened trash can nearby. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an oven. Huh, weird. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Hopefully, this discovery doesn't ruin your TextWorld experience! You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a dining chair. Now why would someone leave that there? But the thing hasn't got anything on it.There is an open sliding patio door leading east.

* close cutlery drawer

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean pot that I just brought from the workbench in the backyard
2) Clean pots typically belong in kitchen storage areas like cupboards
3) Looking at the environment, there's a kitchen cupboard that's currently empty
4) Among the available actions, I can "insert clean pot into kitchen cupboard"
5) Since this is a proper location for a clean pot, this action should increase the score
6) Other options like trash can, fridge, or leaving it on tables/chairs don't make logical sense for storing clean cookware

Consideration: The clean pot should be stored in the kitchen cupboard since that's the proper storage location for clean cookware. This should improve the score like previous correct placements did.

Next action: insert clean pot into kitchen cupboard
