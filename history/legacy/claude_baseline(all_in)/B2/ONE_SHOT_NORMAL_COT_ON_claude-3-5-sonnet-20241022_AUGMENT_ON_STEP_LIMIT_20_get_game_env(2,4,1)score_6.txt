The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have:
   - A pair of blue moccasins in our inventory
   - Brown moccasins on the nightstand
   - Clean azure skirt on the dressing table
   - Clean plaid pullover on the nightstand

2) From the example walkthrough, we learned:
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Caps go on hat rack
   - Clean clothes might go in wardrobe or chest of drawers

3) Since we have a pair of blue moccasins in our inventory, and there's a wardrobe and chest of drawers:
   - Shoes typically belong in a wardrobe or chest of drawers for storage
   - Both storage options are currently empty

4) Let's try putting the blue moccasins in the wardrobe first, as it's a common place to store shoes.

Consideration: The blue moccasins are in our inventory and need proper storage. The wardrobe is an appropriate place for shoes.

Next action: insert blue moccasins into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Clean clothes go in closets/wardrobes
   - Shoes like moccasins typically go on shoe racks/cabinets
   - The blue moccasins are currently in the wrong place

2) Looking at the current environment:
   - We're in a bedroom
   - There's a pair of blue moccasins in the wardrobe (wrong place)
   - There's a south exit that might lead to where shoes belong

3) The first step should be:
   - Take the blue moccasins from the wardrobe since we know they're in the wrong place
   - We'll likely need to move them to a shoe rack/cabinet in another room

4) Other items like the clean clothes can wait since we know the blue moccasins are definitely in the wrong place

Consideration: Since the blue moccasins are confirmed to be in the wrong location, we should take them first so we can move them to their proper location later.

Next action: take blue moccasins from wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. From the example walkthrough, I can see that:
   - Dirty clothes go to washing machine
   - Wet clothes go to clothes drier
   - Caps/hats go to hat rack
   - Shoes/moccasins might go to shoe cabinet (since there was one mentioned in corridor)

2. I currently have blue moccasins in my inventory, and I tried putting them in the wardrobe but got feedback that it was the wrong position and should go "somewhere else, maybe the other room"

3. Since there was a shoe cabinet mentioned in the corridor in the example walkthrough, that's likely where shoes should go

4. To reach the shoe cabinet, I need to first go south to the corridor

Therefore, the most logical next action is to go south to reach the corridor where I can likely find the shoe cabinet.

Next action: go south

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have blue moccasins in my inventory, which are shoes
2. Looking at the environment, there's a shoe cabinet which is specifically meant for storing shoes
3. From the previous attempt, putting the moccasins in the wardrobe was wrong
4. The shoe cabinet is the most logical place for shoes
5. Other options like hat rack, key holder, umbrella stand, and coat hanger are not meant for shoes
6. In text adventure games, putting items in their logical locations usually increases the score

Next action: insert blue moccasins into shoe cabinet

This is the most logical action because:
- Shoes belong in a shoe cabinet
- The shoe cabinet is currently empty
- It follows common sense organization
- Previous example showed that items need to be in their proper locations to get points

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items:
   - blue moccasins in shoe cabinet (already correctly placed)
   - clean white skirt on coat hanger
   - clean white socks on floor

2. From the example walkthrough, we can learn:
   - Clothes like skirts should probably be in a wardrobe
   - Socks might belong in a drawer or wardrobe
   - The wardrobe seems to be in another room (north)

3. Since we need to move items to their proper locations:
   - We should first take the items that are not in their proper place
   - The white skirt on the coat hanger is likely not in its proper place
   - We'll need to move it to what's likely a bedroom or closet to the north

4. Priority:
   - The white skirt should be moved first since it's clearly visible and likely belongs in a wardrobe

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

This will allow us to then move north and find a more appropriate storage location for the skirt, likely improving our score when we place it correctly.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I have a clean white skirt in my inventory
2. I see clean white socks on the floor
3. From the example walkthrough:
   - Clean clothes typically go on hangers/racks
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet (which I already did with the moccasins)
4. Since the white skirt is clean, it should go on the coat hanger
5. The socks can be dealt with after placing the skirt

Next action: put clean white skirt on coat hanger

Reasoning:
- This follows the pattern from the example where items are put in their logical places
- Clean clothes belong on hangers/racks, not in shoe cabinets or umbrella stands
- The coat hanger is currently empty and is the most appropriate place for a clean skirt
- This action is likely to increase the score since it's putting an item in its proper location

Current enviroment: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a pair of blue moccasins, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. On the coat hanger you can see a clean white skirt.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.There is a pair of clean white socks on the floor.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. From the example walkthrough, I see that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobes
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinets
   - Hats go on hat racks
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machines
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier

2. Looking at the current environment and available items:
   - The clean white skirt is on a coat hanger
   - The clean white socks are on the floor
   - The blue moccasins are already in the shoe cabinet (correct position)

3. Since clean clothes should be in the wardrobe, and there's a clean white skirt and clean white socks, we should move these to the wardrobe which is likely in the other room.

4. The first step would be to take one of these clean items to move it to the wardrobe.

5. Since the clean white socks are on the floor, it makes sense to pick those up first (items on the floor should be prioritized).

Next action: take clean white socks

   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in dryer

2) Looking at my inventory:

3) Current situation:
   - I'm in the corridor
   - The wardrobe is likely in another room
   - Clean clothes should be stored in the wardrobe

4) Previous actions:
   - We successfully put blue moccasins in shoe cabinet
   - We tried to put clean white skirt in coat hanger but it was wrong
   - This suggests clean clothes belong elsewhere

5) Logical next step:
   - Since I have clean socks and clean clothes belong in wardrobe
   - The wardrobe must be in the room to the north
   - I should go north to access the wardrobe

Consideration: I need to go north to reach the room with the wardrobe where clean clothes should be stored.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have several items that might need to be put in their proper places:
   - brown moccasins on nightstand
   - clean azure skirt on dressing table
   - clean plaid pullover on nightstand

2. From the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough and action history:
   - Shoes (moccasins) belong in the shoe cabinet in the corridor
   - Clean clothes often belong in storage furniture like wardrobes or chest of drawers

3. Since we're in the bedroom and see brown moccasins, similar to the previous blue moccasins that went to the shoe cabinet, we should probably move these to the corridor as well.

4. Therefore, the first logical step would be to take the brown moccasins so we can later move them to the shoe cabinet in the corridor.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have brown moccasins
2) From the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough and history:
   - Blue moccasins were correctly placed in shoe cabinet in the corridor
   - Clean socks went into chest of drawers
   - Clean clothes seem to go in storage furniture (wardrobe, chest of drawers)
   - Shoes specifically go in shoe cabinet

3) Since I have brown moccasins and we know:
   - They're shoes
   - The example showed shoes belong in shoe cabinet
   - The shoe cabinet is in the corridor
   - Current location is bedroom

4) Therefore:
   - I should go to the corridor to put the brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet
   - The direction to the corridor is south

Consideration: Based on the successful pattern with blue moccasins earlier, I should go to the corridor to put these brown moccasins in the shoe cabinet.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at my inventory, I have brown moccasins
2) From the previous successful actions in the example walkthrough and action history:
   - Blue moccasins were correctly placed in the shoe cabinet (+1 score)
   - This suggests that moccasins belong in the shoe cabinet
3) The shoe cabinet is a storage place specifically designed for shoes
4) Since I'm currently in the corridor with the shoe cabinet, and I'm holding brown moccasins, it makes sense to put them there

Consideration: Since shoes belong in the shoe cabinet (as demonstrated by the blue moccasins), and I'm holding brown moccasins, I should put them in the shoe cabinet to improve my score.

Next action: insert brown moccasins into shoe cabinet

The shoe cabinet contains a pair of brown moccasins and a pair of blue moccasins, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. Looking at the environment, we have a clean white skirt on a coat hanger in the corridor.
2. From the example walkthrough, clean clothes typically belong in storage furniture like chest of drawers or wardrobe in the bedroom.
3. The skirt is clean, so it shouldn't go in the washing machine.
4. We previously tried putting the skirt on the coat hanger and got "Wrong position" message.
5. The bedroom is to the north, and that's where we previously successfully stored clean socks in a chest of drawers.
6. Therefore, we should take the clean white skirt and bring it to the bedroom to store it properly.

Next action: take clean white skirt from coat hanger

This is the logical first step because:
1. We need to get the skirt before we can move it
2. We know it's in the wrong place currently
3. After taking it, we can go north to the bedroom to find proper storage for it

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm holding a clean white skirt
2. From the example walkthrough, I can learn:
   - Clean clothes typically go in storage furniture (like chest of drawers)
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on hat rack
3. The clean white skirt was previously on a coat hanger, but that was wrong
4. Since it's a clean clothing item, it probably belongs in the bedroom where storage furniture is
5. Looking at my current location (corridor), I can go north to the bedroom
6. None of the furniture in the corridor seems appropriate for storing clean clothes

Next action: go north

Reasoning: 
- The clean white skirt needs to be stored properly
- The bedroom likely has appropriate storage furniture (like wardrobe or chest of drawers)
- We need to go to the bedroom first before we can find the proper storage location
- This follows the pattern from earlier where we moved clean socks to the chest of drawers in the bedroom

But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently holding a clean white skirt
2) Looking at previous successful actions:
   - Clean white socks went into chest of drawers
   - Shoes went into shoe cabinet in corridor
   - Clean clothes generally belong in storage furniture in bedroom

3) Looking at the environment:
   - There's a wardrobe and chest of drawers, both are proper storage for clean clothes
   - The wardrobe seems to be the most appropriate place for hanging clothes like skirts

4) Previous attempt to put the skirt on coat hanger in corridor was wrong
   - This confirms clean clothes belong in bedroom storage

5) Since this is a clean white skirt, and wardrobes are typically used for hanging clothes like skirts:
   - The wardrobe in the bedroom is likely the correct location

Consideration: The clean white skirt should go in the wardrobe since it's a clean clothing item and wardrobes are meant for hanging clothes like skirts.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, we have several clean clothing items:
   - clean azure skirt (on dressing table)
   - clean plaid pullover (on nightstand)
   - clean white skirt (in wardrobe)
   - clean white socks (in chest of drawers)

2) From the example walkthrough and previous actions, I can deduce:
   - Clean clothes typically belong in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - The white skirt and white socks are already in their correct locations (we got points for these)

3) Therefore, we should focus on the remaining clean items:
   - clean azure skirt
   - clean plaid pullover

4) Since they're clean items, they likely belong in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers

5) The most straightforward next step would be to take one of these items first

Consideration: The clean azure skirt is currently on the dressing table and as a clean clothing item, it probably belongs in the wardrobe. Let's start by taking it.

Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm currently holding a clean azure skirt
2. From the example walkthrough, I learned that:
   - Clean clothes typically go in the wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - Dirty clothes go in washing machine
   - Wet clothes go in clothes drier
   - Shoes go in shoe cabinet
   - Hats go on hat rack
3. Since the azure skirt is clean, it should go in either the wardrobe or chest of drawers
4. Looking at previous successful actions, clean skirts specifically went into the wardrobe (like the clean white skirt)
5. Therefore, the clean azure skirt should also go into the wardrobe

Next action: insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe

This action follows the pattern we've seen before and should improve the score by putting the clean skirt in its proper location.

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean azure skirt and a clean white skirt. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a pair of clean white socks. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment and available items:
   - clean plaid pullover on nightstand
   - clean azure skirt and clean white skirt in wardrobe
   - clean white socks in chest of drawers

2) From the example walkthrough and previous actions:
   - Clean clothes typically go in wardrobe or chest of drawers
   - The clean azure skirt and clean white skirt are already in the wardrobe (right position)
   - The clean white socks are already in chest of drawers (right position)

3) The only item not in its proper storage location is:
   - clean plaid pullover on nightstand
   - Since it's a clean clothing item, it should go in either wardrobe or chest of drawers

4) Therefore, we should:
   - First take the clean plaid pullover from the nightstand
   - Then in the next turn we can try putting it in the wardrobe (since other clean clothes are there)

Consideration: The clean plaid pullover is currently on the nightstand and needs to be properly stored. As a clean clothing item, it should be moved to proper storage furniture.

Next action: take clean plaid pullover from nightstand

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

Consideration:
1. I'm holding a clean plaid pullover
2. Looking at previous successful actions:
   - Clean clothes (skirts) went into the wardrobe
   - Clean socks went into chest of drawers
3. The pullover is a clean piece of clothing, similar to skirts
4. The wardrobe seems to be for storing clean clothes that you wear on your upper body or as full garments
5. The chest of drawers seems to be for smaller items like socks
6. Therefore, the wardrobe would be the most logical place for a clean pullover

Next action: insert clean plaid pullover into wardrobe

This action makes the most sense because:
- The pullover is clean
- It's a larger clothing item like the skirts that are already correctly placed in the wardrobe
- Previous successful actions show that the wardrobe is the right place for clean clothes
- The wardrobe is typically used for storing shirts, pullovers, and other hanging clothes
