Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their appropriate locations. The clean white polo shirt should likely be placed in a location that makes sense for clothing. The wardrobe was a good place for the plaid polo shirt, but since I'm in the living room now, I should consider where clothing might logically be placed. The armchair already has a gray coat on it, which suggests it might be a place for clothing. Alternatively, the sofa has a clean checkered jumper, which also suggests it might be a place for clothing.

The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wastepaper basket. What a letdown! The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. Based on previous actions, clothing items like shirts and jumpers were placed in the wardrobe in the bedroom. Therefore, it is likely that the gray coat and brown suit should also be placed in the wardrobe. The dictionary, being a book, might belong in the bookcase, although it is currently empty. I should first focus on collecting the clothing items to move them to the wardrobe.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. The gray coat is currently in my inventory, and I need to determine the most appropriate place for it. The wardrobe in the bedroom has been a successful location for clothing items so far, but since I'm in the living room, I should consider if there's a suitable spot here. The bookcase and wastepaper basket are empty, and the end table has a brown suit on it, which suggests it might be a place for clothing. However, the wardrobe has been the right place for clothing items before, so it might be best to take the gray coat to the bedroom and place it in the wardrobe.

Next action: go west

The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.
