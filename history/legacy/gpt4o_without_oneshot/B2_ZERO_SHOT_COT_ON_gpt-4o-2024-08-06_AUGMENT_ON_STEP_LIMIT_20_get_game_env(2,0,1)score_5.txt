Consideration: To improve my score, I should focus on organizing the items in the backyard by placing them in logical or appropriate locations. The milk should be placed somewhere that makes sense in the context of the environment. Since milk is typically associated with food or cooking, placing it on the BBQ might be a reasonable choice. However, I should also consider examining the items in the backyard to gather more information about their potential uses or connections to the milk.

Consideration: To improve my score, I should focus on organizing the items in the backyard by placing them in logical or appropriate locations. The wet white jumper on the patio chair should be hung on the clothesline to dry, which is a logical action. The wooden spoon on the BBQ might be better suited on the workbench or patio table, but I should first focus on the most obvious task. The milk doesn't seem to have an immediate logical place in the backyard, so I should leave it for now.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their proper locations. I have some milk in my inventory, and there are several places where I can put it. The BBQ, clothesline, patio chair, patio table, and workbench are all potential locations. Since the milk is a consumable item, it might be more appropriate to place it on the patio table, which is often used for dining or holding food-related items. Additionally, the patio table is currently empty, making it a suitable spot for placing the milk.

Consideration: To improve my score, I need to place items in their correct locations. The milk is currently on the patio table, but the game indicated that it should be placed somewhere else, possibly in another room. Since there is an open sliding patio door leading west, it might lead to a kitchen or dining area where milk would be more appropriately placed. However, before moving the milk, I should consider examining the items in the backyard to see if there are any other actions that could increase my score.

Consideration: The goal is to place items in their correct locations to improve the score. The wooden spoon was previously placed on the BBQ, but that was indicated as the wrong position. Since the kitchen is a more appropriate place for kitchen utensils, it would be logical to move the wooden spoon there. The clean pot on the workbench might also belong in the kitchen, but first, I should focus on relocating the wooden spoon.

There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. The fridge contains some milk. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on.

You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. The cutlery drawer contains a wooden spoon. Now that's what I call TextWorld!

The counter appears to be empty. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it!

Consideration: The dirty cake slice is currently in the trash can, but it seems that this is not the correct location for it. Since the trash can is in the kitchen, and the action of putting the dirty cake slice there was marked as incorrect, it might need to be placed in another room. I should take the dirty cake slice out of the trash can and consider where it might belong. 

Next action: take dirty cake slice from trash can
