Another room: -= Corridor =-Well, here we are in a corridor.You can make out an opened shoe cabinet. The shoe cabinet contains a pair of clean white socks and a pair of blue moccasins, so there's that. You scan the room for a hat rack, and you find a hat rack. However, the hat rack, like an empty hat rack, has nothing on it. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an umbrella stand. But the thing is empty. You can make out a key holder. But there isn't a thing on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You see a coat hanger. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hopefully this doesn't make you too upset.There is an exit to the north. Don't worry, there is no door.
Current environment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a pair of brown moccasins, a clean plaid pullover and a clean azure skirt. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
