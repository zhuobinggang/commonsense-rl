The chest of drawers is empty, what a horrible day! You can make out a bed. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You see a dark carpet. Make a note of this, you might have to put stuff on or in it later on. You see a pair of black gloves on the dark carpet. Now that's what I call TextWorld! What's that over there? It looks like it's a desk. The desk is normal. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of trash. Hm. Oh well You see a desk chair. But the thing is empty. You see a nightstand. You wonder idly who left that here. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a nightstand in a room. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a dressing table. The dressing table is normal. However, the dressing table, like an empty dressing table, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the dressing table.
