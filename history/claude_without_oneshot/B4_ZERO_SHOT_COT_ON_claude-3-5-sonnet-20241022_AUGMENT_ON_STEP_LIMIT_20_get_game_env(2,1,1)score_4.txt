You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm carrying a clean plaid polo shirt, which is a clothing item
2) Looking at the environment, there are several furniture pieces where clothes could be stored:
   - A wardrobe (traditional place for hanging clothes)
   - A chest of drawers (good for folded clothes)
   - A bed (not proper storage)
   - Other surfaces (desk, chair, etc. - not proper storage)

3) Among these options:
   - Wardrobe is the most appropriate place for hanging clothes
   - It's already opened, making it convenient
   - Wardrobes are specifically designed for storing clothes

4) Therefore, putting the shirt in the wardrobe would be the most logical choice to properly organize the room and likely improve the score.

Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) The goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve score
2) Currently, there's only one movable item: the clean plaid polo shirt
3) The shirt is already in the wardrobe, and when it was put there, the score increased by one point
4) This indicates the wardrobe is the correct location for the shirt
5) Looking at the other furniture (bed, desk, chest of drawers, etc.), they are all empty
6) Since the shirt is already in its correct place (wardrobe) and there are no other items to move, there's nothing more to organize

Therefore, the best action would be to:
- Go east to explore other rooms that might have items to organize, since we've completed everything possible in this room

Next action: go east

The wastepaper basket is empty! You make out an opened bookcase. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You scan the room for a sofa, and you find a sofa. You see a clean checkered jumper on the sofa. You smell an intriguing smell, and follow it to a grey carpet. The grey carpet is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You can make out an armchair. You shudder, but continue examining the armchair. You see a gray coat on the armchair. You can make out a side table. But there isn't a thing on it. Hm. Oh well You scan the room, seeing a TV stand. The TV stand is usual. However, the TV stand, like an empty TV stand, has nothing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the TV stand. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto an end table. You see a brown suit on the end table. Were you looking for a coffee table? Because look over there, it's a coffee table. You see a dictionary on the coffee table.You don't like doors? Why not try going west, that entranceway is not blocked by one.There is a clean white polo shirt on the floor.

Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the environment, I see several clothing items and furniture:
   - brown suit on end table
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - clean white polo shirt on floor
   - dictionary on coffee table

2) From the previous action where putting a shirt in the wardrobe gave a point, I can deduce:
   - Clothing items likely belong in the wardrobe
   - The wardrobe is in the room to the west (where we came from)

3) To maximize score:
   - All clothing items should be moved to the wardrobe
   - Need to pick up items before moving them
   - Can only carry one item at a time

4) Strategy:
   - Pick up one clothing item
   - Go west to wardrobe
   - Put it in wardrobe
   - Repeat for other clothing items

5) Starting with the item on the floor is logical as it's not properly placed anywhere:

Consideration: The clean white polo shirt is on the floor, which is clearly not its proper place. Since we know clothing goes in the wardrobe (from previous success), we should pick this up first.

Next action: take clean white polo shirt

3) In the previous room, I got a point for putting a polo shirt in the wardrobe
4) However, I can't see a wardrobe in this room
5) The available storage furniture includes:
   - bookcase
   - wastepaper basket
6) Since I got a point for putting clothes in a wardrobe before, I should:
   - Go back to the room with the wardrobe to store the polo shirt properly
   - The west direction leads back to the previous room

Consideration: Since clothes belong in a wardrobe (as proven by the previous successful action), and the wardrobe is in the room to the west, I should return there.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I have a clean white polo shirt in my inventory
2) From the previous action where I got a point for putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, I can deduce that clothing items belong in storage furniture
3) In this room, there are two storage furniture pieces:
   - wardrobe (already contains the plaid polo shirt)
   - chest of drawers (currently empty)
4) Since both are storage furniture for clothes, either might be correct
5) However, since the wardrobe already has a similar item (another polo shirt), it's likely that's the intended storage location
6) The game rewarded putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, so it's logical that the white polo shirt belongs there too

Consideration: Based on the pattern of getting a point for putting the plaid polo shirt in the wardrobe, and the fact that both items are polo shirts, the white polo shirt likely belongs in the wardrobe as well.

   - I put clean white polo shirt in wardrobe (+1 point)
3) Both shirts are currently in the wardrobe and gave points
4) Looking at the current environment:
   - There are multiple furniture pieces (bed, desk, chest of drawers, etc.)
   - All furniture appears empty
   - The only items are the shirts in the wardrobe
5) Since putting the shirts in the wardrobe increased the score, they seem to be in their correct location
6) There's nothing else to pick up or move around

Consideration: Since both shirts are already in their correct location (wardrobe) and there are no other items to move, there's no immediate action that would improve the score. The best action would be to explore more to find other items, which means going to another room.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) From previous actions, I've successfully put polo shirts in the wardrobe in the bedroom, which increased the score.

2) Looking at the current environment, there are several clothing items:
   - clean checkered jumper on sofa
   - gray coat on armchair
   - brown suit on end table

3) Given that clothing items belonged in the wardrobe before, it's likely these clothing items should also go in the wardrobe.

4) To move any clothing to the wardrobe, I first need to pick it up.

5) Among the clothing items:
   - The brown suit is on the end table
   - The gray coat is on the armchair
   - The clean checkered jumper is on the sofa

6) Any of these would be a good choice to start with, as they likely need to go to the wardrobe.

7) Let's start with one item - the brown suit seems like a formal piece of clothing that definitely belongs in a wardrobe.

Consideration: The brown suit is a clothing item that should be stored in the wardrobe based on previous successful actions with other clothing items. First step is to take it.

Next action: take brown suit from end table

2) Looking at the environment, there are several possible places to put it:
   - bookcase
   - wastepaper basket
   - TV stand
   - armchair
   - coffee table
   - end table
   - grey carpet
   - side table
   - sofa

3) From previous text games experience:
   - Suits typically belong in wardrobes or closets
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom (west)
   - None of the locations in this room seem appropriate for a suit

4) Given that:
   - We successfully put shirts in the wardrobe before
   - The wardrobe is in the bedroom
   - A suit is also a clothing item

Therefore, I should:
Next action: go west

This will take me back to the bedroom where I can try to put the brown suit in the wardrobe, which is likely its proper location.

Consideration: <fill in>

Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently carrying a brown suit and need to put it somewhere proper

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage locations:
- wardrobe (currently contains polo shirts)
- chest of drawers (empty)
- desk (empty)
- dressing table (empty)
- bed (empty)
- nightstand (empty)

3) Considering what would be most logical:
- A wardrobe is typically used to store clothes, especially formal wear like suits
- The fact that other clothes (polo shirts) are already in the wardrobe suggests it's the right place
- Previous actions with the polo shirts in the wardrobe increased the score

4) Therefore, putting the brown suit in the wardrobe is likely to be the correct action and increase the score

Consideration: The wardrobe seems to be the most appropriate storage location for clothing items, and previous actions confirm this increases the score.

Next action: insert brown suit into wardrobe

   - The wardrobe is currently closed
3) To check if there are more clothes to put away:
   - I should examine the wardrobe to see if there's a description of what belongs in it
   - I need to open it first since it's currently closed
4) The other furniture pieces (desk, bed, etc.) appear empty based on the environment description
5) The wardrobe has been the correct place for clothing items so far

Consideration: Since the wardrobe has been the correct location for clothes and might have more items that belong in it, I should open it to check its contents and description.

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state:
- We have successfully put 3 clothing items in the wardrobe (brown suit, clean white polo shirt, clean plaid polo shirt)
- All these items are in their correct location (we got points for each)
- The wardrobe is currently open
- Other furniture pieces (chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, desk, dressing table) are empty

2) Analyzing the situation:
- We've already placed all visible clothing items in their proper place
- We got points for each correct placement
- There don't seem to be any more items to move around
- The wardrobe is still open and contains all the properly placed items

3) Best practice in text adventures:
- When you're done using a container, it's usually good practice to close it
- We've finished putting everything in the wardrobe
- The wardrobe is currently open

4) Conclusion:
Since we've completed organizing the clothes and there are no more items to move, we should close the wardrobe to properly finish our task.

   - The wardrobe is currently closed

3) Current situation:
   - I'm in the bedroom
   - I don't have anything in my inventory
   - There are several furniture pieces but they're all empty
   - The wardrobe contains all the clothing items I've collected

4) Considering next steps:
   - Since I've already placed items in the wardrobe and got points
   - I should check if there are any other items I can find
   - To do this efficiently, I should explore the livingroom again
   - The livingroom is to the east

5) Decision:
   - Since I've cleared this room and stored items properly
   - Best action is to go explore the other room for more items

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to put things in their proper locations, likely in the wardrobe in the bedroom based on previous successful actions.

2) Looking at the items in the room:
- clean checkered jumper (on sofa)
- gray coat (on armchair)
- dictionary (on coffee table)

3) Based on previous successful actions:
- I've put clothing items (polo shirts, suit) in the wardrobe
- All clothing items went into the wardrobe and increased the score

4) Therefore:
- The clothing items (jumper and coat) likely belong in the wardrobe
- The dictionary probably belongs somewhere else (maybe bookcase)

5) I should take one clothing item first, then go to the bedroom to put it in the wardrobe.

6) Either the jumper or coat would work, but let's start with the jumper since it's similar to the other clothing items we've already placed.

Consideration: Taking the clean checkered jumper is the logical next step as it's a clothing item that likely belongs in the wardrobe, similar to the polo shirts and suit we successfully placed earlier.

Next action: take clean checkered jumper from sofa

Let me think about this step by step:

1) My goal is to put things in their proper locations to improve my score
2) I'm currently holding a clean checkered jumper
3) Looking at previous successful actions:
   - Clothing items like polo shirts and suits went into the wardrobe
   - Those actions increased the score
4) The wardrobe seems to be the designated storage place for clothing items
5) However, the wardrobe is currently closed
6) Before I can put the jumper in the wardrobe, I need to open it first

Therefore:
- I should first open the wardrobe before attempting to put the jumper inside
- This matches with the logical pattern of storing clothes in a wardrobe

Consideration: Opening the wardrobe is necessary before I can store the clean checkered jumper inside it, which is likely the proper location for clothing items based on previous successful actions.

Next action: open wardrobe

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You find yourself in a bedroom. A typical kind of place.You see an opened wardrobe, which looks large, in the room. The wardrobe contains a brown suit, a clean white polo shirt and a clean plaid polo shirt. As if things weren't amazing enough already, you can even see a chest of drawers. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. What a letdown! The chest of drawers is empty! You scan the room for a bed, and you find a bed. The bed is large. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of garbage. You swear loudly. You make out a desk chair. Now why would someone leave that there? The desk chair is usual. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a nightstand. The nightstand is standard. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it? You can make out a dark carpet. The dark carpet is typical. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a desk. Wow, isn't TextWorld just the best? The desk appears to be empty. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Hm. Oh wellYou need an exit without a door? You should try going east.

Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>


Let me think about this step by step:

1) I'm currently carrying a clean checkered jumper that needs to be stored properly

2) Looking at the environment, there are several storage options:
- Wardrobe (already contains clothes like suits and shirts)
- Chest of drawers (currently empty)
- Other furniture (bed, desk, etc.)

3) Since the wardrobe already contains other clothing items and previous actions of putting clothes in the wardrobe gave points, this suggests the wardrobe is the proper storage location for clothing items.

4) Previous successful actions that gave points:
- Putting clean plaid polo shirt in wardrobe (+1 point)
- Putting clean white polo shirt in wardrobe (+1 point)
- Putting brown suit in wardrobe (+1 point)

5) Following this pattern, the clean checkered jumper (being a clothing item) should also go in the wardrobe.

Consideration: The wardrobe seems to be the proper storage location for clothing items, as evidenced by previous successful actions that earned points. The clean checkered jumper is a clothing item, so it should also go in the wardrobe.

Next action: insert clean checkered jumper into wardrobe

Let me think about this step by step:

1) Looking at the current state:
- I'm in the bedroom
- The wardrobe is open and contains several clothing items
- All items I've placed in the wardrobe so far have increased my score
- This suggests the wardrobe is the correct storage location for clothes

2) Checking what I've done:
- I've already put the brown suit, clean white polo shirt, clean plaid polo shirt, and clean checkered jumper in the wardrobe
- Each time I got a point for correct placement

3) Current situation:
- All items appear to be in their proper place (the wardrobe)
- I've received points for all placements
- The wardrobe is still open

4) Best next step:
- Since all items are in their correct locations
- And the wardrobe is open
- The logical next step would be to close the wardrobe to maintain order

Consideration: Since all clothes are properly stored and I've gotten points for each, I should close the wardrobe to finish organizing the room properly.

   - Put clean plaid polo shirt in wardrobe (+1 point)
   - Put clean white polo shirt in wardrobe (+1 point)
   - Put brown suit in wardrobe (+1 point)
   - Put clean checkered jumper in wardrobe (+1 point)

3) Current situation:
   - I'm in the bedroom
   - The wardrobe is closed
   - There might be more clothes to find and store
   - I should check what's in the wardrobe to make sure everything is still there

4) Looking at available actions:
   - Opening the wardrobe would let me verify its contents
   - Other actions like examining furniture might help find more items to store
   - The wardrobe seems to be the key storage location for clothes

5) Best next step:
   - Since the wardrobe is the main storage location and it's currently closed, I should open it to verify its contents and prepare for any additional items we might find.

Consideration: Opening the wardrobe will help confirm all previously stored items are there and prepare for storing any additional items we might find.

     * clean plaid polo shirt
     * clean white polo shirt
     * brown suit
     * clean checkered jumper
   - Each time I put clothing in the wardrobe, I got a point
3) Current environment shows several furniture pieces:
   - Most are empty (chest of drawers, bed, desk chair, nightstand, desk, dressing table)
   - The wardrobe contains all the clothing items I've placed
4) Looking at available actions:
   - Most are just examine actions
   - The wardrobe seems to be the key furniture for storing clothes
5) Since I'm in the bedroom and don't see any new clothing items to store:
   - I should go look in other rooms for more clothing items to store
   - The east direction leads to the livingroom where I found previous items

Consideration: Since there's nothing more to store in this room, and I've confirmed all the clothes are properly stored in the wardrobe, I should look for more items in the livingroom.

Next action: go east
