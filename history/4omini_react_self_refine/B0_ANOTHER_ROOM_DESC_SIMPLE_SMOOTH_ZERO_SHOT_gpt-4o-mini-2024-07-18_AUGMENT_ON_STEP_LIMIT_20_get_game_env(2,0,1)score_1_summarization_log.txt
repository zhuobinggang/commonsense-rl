The kitchen cupboard is empty, what a horrible day! You hear a noise behind you and spin around, but you can't see anything other than a cutlery drawer. What a letdown! The cutlery drawer is empty! If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a dishwasher. The light flickers for a second, but nothing else happens. The dishwasher is empty, what a horrible day! You can see an opened trash can nearby. The trash can is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You can see an oven. Huh, weird. The oven is empty! This is the worst thing that could possibly happen, ever! You see a dining table. The dining table is massive. On the dining table you make out a dirty pot. Classic TextWorld. You make out a ladderback chair. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You can make out a counter. On the counter you see a dirty cake slice. You can make out a stove! The stove is conventional. But oh no! there's nothing on this piece of junk. Aw, here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! You can see a dining chair. Now why would someone leave that there? On the dining chair you can see a wet azure skirt. Classic TextWorld.There is an open sliding patio door leading east.
