-= Bedroom =- You find yourself in an empty bedroom. There's a wardrobe with blue moccasins and a plaid pullover inside. Nearby, an open chest of drawers is empty. A large bed sits unused, and a desk chair is also bare. The dark carpet has nothing on it. Leaning against the wall, you accidentally press a secret button, revealing a nightstand, which is also empty. A dressing table holds a clean azure skirt, and a desk has a pair of brown moccasins. You can exit to the south, where there's no door blocking your way.

The environment description:
-= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. The wardrobe contains a clean plaid pullover. Now why would someone leave that there? An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. On the desk you can make out a pair of brown moccasins.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
