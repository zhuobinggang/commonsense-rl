-= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
Response (Response with the new environment description directly):


-= Bedroom =- You find yourself in a bedroom filled with empty furniture. There's an empty wardrobe and a chest of drawers nearby, also empty. A large bed sits in the room, but it's unmade and devoid of any items. A typical desk chair stands nearby, stripped of anything useful. The dark carpet is bare as well. Leaning against the wall, you accidentally press a hidden button, revealing a nightstand with a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover. A dressing table holds a clean azure skirt. There's a normal desk, but like the others, it's empty. If you want to leave, head south; there's no door blocking the way.

What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. However, the nightstand, like an empty nightstand, has nothing on it. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
Response (Response with the new environment description directly):


-= Bedroom =- You find yourself in a bedroom filled with empty furniture. There's an empty wardrobe, a chest of drawers, and a large empty bed. A usual desk chair sits nearby, also empty. The dark carpet has nothing on it, and leaning against the wall reveals a nightstand, which is also empty. A dressing table and a desk are present, but both lack any items. You can exit the room by going south, as there's no door blocking the way.

Task: Simplify the environment description.

-= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately.

-= Bedroom =- You find yourself in an empty bedroom. There's a wardrobe, but it's empty. Nearby, an open chest of drawers is also empty. The large bed has no bedding. A desk chair sits alone, stripped of any items. The dark carpet is bare. Leaning against the wall, you accidentally press a secret button, revealing a nightstand with a pair of brown moccasins. A dressing table stands empty, and a normal desk has nothing on it either. If you want to leave, you can go south; there's no door blocking the way.
