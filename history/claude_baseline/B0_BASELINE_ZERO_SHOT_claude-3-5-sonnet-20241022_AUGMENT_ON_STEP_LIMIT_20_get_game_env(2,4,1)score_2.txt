Environment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Inventory: You are carrying:  a pair of clean white socks
Environment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of blue moccasins, a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.

Inventory: You are carrying:  a clean white skirt
Environment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. The chest of drawers contains a pair of clean white socks. Classic TextWorld. You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. You see a clean azure skirt on the dressing table. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
