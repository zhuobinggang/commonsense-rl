The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a counter. The counter is vast. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You scan the room for a stove, and you find a stove. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Aw, and here you were, all excited for there to be things on it! There is an open frosted-glass door leading east. There is an open patio door leading north. You need an exit without a door? You should try going south. There is an exit to the west. Don't worry, there is no door.
