Your score has just gone up by one point. \nInventory: You are carrying: a meal\nCurrent environment: -= Kitchen =- You've seen better kitchens, but at least this one seems pretty usual. You begin looking for stuff. Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. The fridge contains a raw red potato and a raw chicken leg. You make out a closed oven. Were you looking for a table? Because look over there, it's a table. The table is massive. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You scan the room for a counter, and you find a counter. On the counter you can make out a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a stove. The stove is conventional. However, the stove, like an empty stove, has nothing on it. There is an open patio door leading east. There is a closed frosted-glass door leading west. You don't like doors? Why not try going north, that entranceway is not blocked by one. There is an exit to the south.\nAction templates:\n* inventory\n* examine <object>\n* open <object>\n* take <object> from <object>\n* cook <object> with <stove | oven>\n* drop <object>\n* <slice | dice | chop> <object> with knife\n* prepare meal\n* eat meal\n* go <direction>\nNext action (answer with the command directly):"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "eat meal"}]}
