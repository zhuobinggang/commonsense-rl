Consideration: The goal is to put things in their proper locations and improve the score. You currently have a pair of blue moccasins in your inventory.

Next Action: Examine the chest of drawers to see if it's a suitable location for the blue moccasins, and if so, insert them into the chest of drawers.

Considering the current state of the environment and your inventory, here's a step-by-step plan to put things in their proper locations and potentially improve your score:

1. **Examine the clean azure skirt on the dressing table.**
   - This will provide more information about the item, and you might find clues about where it belongs.

2. **Take the clean azure skirt from the dressing table.**
   - Now that you know more about the skirt, take it with you.

3. **Insert the clean azure skirt into the wardrobe.**
   - Since the wardrobe is currently empty, placing an item inside may improve your score.

So, the next action would be:
   - **Insert clean azure skirt into wardrobe.**

Current enviroment: -= Bedroom =-You've just shown up in a bedroom. You can barely contain your excitement.What's that over there? It looks like it's a wardrobe. What a letdown! The wardrobe is empty! An open chest of drawers is close by. Empty! What kind of nightmare TextWorld is this? You can make out a bed. The bed is large. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it? You make out a desk chair. The desk chair is usual. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. You make out a dark carpet. Why don't you take a picture of it, it'll last longer! But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a nightstand. I guess it's true what they say, if you're looking for a nightstand, go to TextWorld. You see a pair of brown moccasins and a clean plaid pullover on the nightstand, so there's that. You can make out a dressing table. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. Look over there! a desk. The desk is normal. However, the desk, like an empty desk, has nothing on it. You make a mental note to not get your hopes up the next time you see a desk in a room.You don't like doors? Why not try going south, that entranceway is not blocked by one.
