Consideration: The trench coat that I'm currently carrying likely belongs on the coat hanger since a coat hanger is typically used for hanging coats, jackets, and similar types of clothing. Placing items where they are conventionally meant to be can improve my score in the game.

Next action: put trench coat on coat hanger

Consideration: To improve the score, items should be placed in their appropriate locations. The blue coat is currently in the shoe cabinet, but typically, coats should be hung on a coat hanger to be properly stored. If there's space on the coat hanger where currently only a trench coat is hanging, it would be reasonable to place the blue coat there as well.

Next action: take blue coat from shoe cabinet

Consideration: The blue coat was previously in the shoe cabinet, which isn't its proper place. Coats are typically hung on coat hangers to keep them tidy and to maintain their shape.
