Considering the goal is to put things in their proper locations and improve the score, let's analyze the situation:

1. The folding chair is shaky and has nothing on it.
2. There are eggs on the shelf.

To improve the score, we need to place the green hot pepper in the appropriate location. Since the folding chair is shaky and doesn't seem like a suitable place for items, and the eggs are already on the shelf, we should put the green hot pepper on the shelf.

**Next action:** Put green hot pepper on the shelf.
