Consideration: Since the kitchen is empty and things seem out of place, a good first step would be to start by cleaning up what is out of place and organizing the items. The dirty pie plate in the kitchen cupboard stands out as something that should be cleaned and perhaps placed somewhere else, like on the dining table or in the dishwasher if it was not empty. Since I am carrying nothing and there is a dirty item that can be moved, it might be a good starting point to improve the situation.

Consideration: To properly organize the kitchen and potentially increase the score in a text adventure game, items should be placed where they logically belong. A dirty pie plate would most likely need to be cleaned before it is stored away. Since the dishwasher is empty, putting the dirty pie plate in the dishwasher would be the first step in cleaning it and then storing it properly.
