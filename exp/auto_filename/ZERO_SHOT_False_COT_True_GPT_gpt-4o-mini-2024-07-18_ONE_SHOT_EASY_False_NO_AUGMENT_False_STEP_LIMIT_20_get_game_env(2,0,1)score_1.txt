Consideration: The clean pot is currently in my inventory, and I need to find a proper location for it. Since the workbench is empty and I previously attempted to put the clean pot there, it seems like the best option. However, I should also consider if there are any other suitable locations. The patio table is stylish but also empty, so I will try putting the clean pot on the workbench again, as it seems to be the most logical place for it.
