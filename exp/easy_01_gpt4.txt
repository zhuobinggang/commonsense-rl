Consideration: To organize items properly, they should be placed where they belong. Given the objects in the environment, trench coats are typically hung on coat hangers to prevent them from wrinkling or getting damaged. This would likely increase the score, as it is the correct place for such an item.

Consideration: To improve the score by putting things in their proper locations, we need to identify items that are out of place and then determine where they belong. The blue coat inside the shoe cabinet seems out of place, as coats typically do not belong in shoe cabinets. There is a coat hanger in the environment, where the trench coat was successfully hung earlier (as indicated by the action history), which suggests that the appropriate location for coats is on the coat hanger. 

Next action: take blue coat from shoe cabinet
