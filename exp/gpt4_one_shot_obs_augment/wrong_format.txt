Question: To put things in there proper locations and improve your score, what should you do? Think step by step then choose 'one' action from above list.
Consideration: <fill in>
Next action: <fill in>
Consideration:
The bedroom seems to hold primarily clothes and personal items, and so far, we've been putting clean clothes away into the wardrobe. The chest of drawers is typically used for storing smaller clothing items like underwear, socks, or shirts. Since the chest of drawers is currently empty, we may need to find items that fit these categories. However, no such items have been mentioned, and all clothes mentioned thus far have been appropriately stored in the wardrobe. There's nothing on the bed, which seems like a missed opportunity for interaction.

The given actions list doesn't offer any obvious next step like finding a piece of clothing to put away, but there's an option to examine the bed. This might reveal items that have been hidden or overlooked, offering a chance to further increase the score.

Next action:
* examine bed
