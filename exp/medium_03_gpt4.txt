Consideration: The proper location for food items is typically inside the kitchen cupboard or the fridge to keep them fresh, unless the items are intended for immediate use in cooking or meal preparation.

Consideration: The chicken leg is a food item. Generally, uncooked chicken needs to be refrigerated to prevent spoilage, while cooked chicken could be placed on a dining area if it is to be eaten soon. However, the description doesn't clarify whether the chicken leg is cooked or uncooked. For the sake of food safety and assuming it has not been mentioned for immediate consumption, refrigeration is a typical choice. Other locations such as the cutlery drawer or the trash can would not be appropriate for food.

Next action: insert chicken leg into fridge

Consideration: One item that seems out of place is the vegetable oil which is usually stored in a cupboard rather than left on the stove.
