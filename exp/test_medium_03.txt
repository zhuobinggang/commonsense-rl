To put things in their proper locations and improve your score, let's consider the current state of your inventory and environment. You have a chicken leg and some vegetable oil in your inventory. The chicken leg is on the counter, and the vegetable oil is on the counter as well.

Considering the available actions, it seems like the next logical step is to use the items in your inventory to interact with the environment. Since the chicken leg is on the counter, and the vegetable oil is also on the counter, let's aim to utilize the chicken leg first.

**Consideration:** The chicken leg is currently on the counter. You want to find a suitable location for it.

**Next action:** `put chicken leg on stove`

This action would move the chicken leg from the counter to the stove, which seems like a reasonable place in a kitchen setting. It aligns with the goal of putting things in their proper locations and could potentially contribute to an improved score.
